First of all what do we see on the cover of this movie Thats right a shapely womans behind.,0.052191,0.36237,0.025794,0.409087,0.052905,Joy
Whether it was Zarchis attempt to make an antirape statement  and I absolutely dont believe it was  is entirely beside the point.,0.110647,0.491739,0.080767,0.020714,0.430114,Disgust
The rapes in the film is uncomfortable brutal and hard to watch.,0.390318,0.634056,0.062105,0.002536,0.126705,Disgust
Theres something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes none.,0.234861,0.478331,0.029936,0.006661,0.426918,Disgust
Really its just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb Caligula Cannibal Ferox etc.  that it attracts only the exploitation crowd.,0.439538,0.586106,0.054104,0.023847,0.086149,Disgust

But considering how inept everything else in the film is acting script etc.,0.502089,0.310789,0.194316,0.032488,0.142067,Anger
I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porncaliber actors do their thing.,0.112757,0.456135,0.306056,0.054457,0.192636,Disgust
Im not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG.,0.144172,0.169702,0.187842,0.11076,0.409646,Sadness

However its also poorly made and after the rape occurs just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of hohum mostly goreless murders and wait for the credits to roll.,0.455665,0.471807,0.053545,0.000669,0.243189,Disgust
This is probably worth watching once if youre a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but Im telling you the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation.,0.287018,0.45181,0.097461,0.027547,0.308149,Disgust

Perfect had then cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when he distracted him in a title match against Marty Janetty.,0.1944,0.052701,0.0254,0.274024,0.342488,Sadness
Michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against Mr Perfect but Michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard Diesel.,0.145879,0.05904,0.006939,0.593347,0.080181,Joy

Hart and Doink had a passable match which Hart won with a sharpshooter.,0.092472,0.072895,0.0642,0.534287,0.10644,Joy
He was then jumped from behind by Lawler.,0.312381,0.47385,0.177743,0.04195,0.160427,Disgust
This bought WWE President Jack Tunney to the ring who told Lawler that he would receive a lifetime ban if he didnt wrestle Hart.,0.339598,0.537304,0.011486,0.06612,0.170254,Disgust

It is worth noting that in the 1970s MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R some of the scenes could almost be rated PG13 by todays standards.,0.309333,0.576425,0.200054,0.003487,0.131287,Disgust

Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager.,0.17022,0.166499,0.035924,0.297492,0.237472,Joy
Once again Joe is conned and before long is homeless.,0.135669,0.466459,0.24203,0.015421,0.30413,Disgust
However Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment.,0.055029,0.158885,0.232594,0.055364,0.536535,Sadness
Without giving away much more of the plot I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams.,0.077757,0.029064,0.15363,0.058169,0.676992,Sadness

I want to make some comments about the movie itself.,0.211644,0.226929,0.209265,0.12395,0.267198,Sadness
First of all the acting is excellent especially the leads.,0.053543,0.067162,0.041478,0.656993,0.067181,Joy

For example there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over.,0.298566,0.316155,0.135037,0.051687,0.329458,Sadness
Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says Hey Im walkin here Im walkin here I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry.,0.287696,0.320283,0.046948,0.022628,0.47512,Sadness

What ensures Ned Kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him.,0.171181,0.213422,0.193527,0.086259,0.388284,Sadness

Indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the Victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd.,0.254533,0.540923,0.080647,0.144022,0.031923,Disgust
Here Ned Kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it.,0.248623,0.64409,0.047775,0.012183,0.216239,Disgust

Although the film basically implies that Cook was essentially the woman in Ned Kellys life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here.,0.107131,0.330421,0.051627,0.092217,0.455398,Sadness

I can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this.,0.17567,0.202356,0.179205,0.038475,0.507401,Sadness
But that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact.,0.197681,0.097252,0.193711,0.037887,0.55968,Sadness
One scene manages to do the speechmaking thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while.,0.081047,0.065747,0.298191,0.029929,0.588386,Sadness
Annoyingly the trial and execution of Ned Kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.,0.174658,0.143074,0.100275,0.004095,0.697245,Sadness

She has a quality that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter.,0.073403,0.077223,0.061885,0.249927,0.412036,Sadness
The rest of the cast is just as solid with Tom Tully as the wrongly accused father being a real standout.,0.564782,0.183917,0.03269,0.01014,0.365475,Anger
Beyond the acting the direction sets lighting and cinematography are all topnotch.,0.361844,0.18015,0.118896,0.181574,0.163985,Anger

If I have one complaint and admittedly its a very very minor quibble its that Tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings.,0.187347,0.24394,0.061089,0.287153,0.162533,Joy
Its a little difficult to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixedup with some of these unsavory characters.,0.089282,0.328891,0.106633,0.060681,0.48447,Sadness
Its not really her fault its just the way Tierney comes across.,0.106506,0.159924,0.356665,0.010007,0.498116,Sadness
She seems a little too beautiful polished and delicate for the part.,0.004101,0.009842,0.029936,0.358312,0.403275,Sadness
But her gentle kind trusting nature add a sense of needed realism to her portrayal.,0.243806,0.027274,0.106485,0.291967,0.229844,Joy

Nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the shows executive producer Fred Freiberger that Vulcans werent supposed to fall in love.,0.057577,0.203907,0.089777,0.266175,0.287575,Sadness
272 However Freiberger reasoned the ice age setting allowed Spock to experience emotions since this was a time when Vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state.,0.223605,0.231433,0.04708,0.150526,0.353555,Sadness
This was a great example of improvisation on Freibergers part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode.,0.151938,0.20155,0.136928,0.338588,0.094678,Joy
Spocks acting here was excellent as Freiberger candidly admitted to Shatner.,0.101747,0.099588,0.045854,0.58058,0.06137,Joy
272 The only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both Spock and McCoy travelled thousands of years back in time McCoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state not just Spock.,0.205947,0.519593,0.098941,0.019462,0.32004,Disgust
But this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows the brilliant SpockMcCoy performance and the originality of this script.,0.262448,0.282631,0.217331,0.027843,0.36493,Sadness

The complex of incidents and of Morverns responses to them are the substance of the book and its achievement in exposing a crosssection of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise.,0.32544,0.287874,0.06844,0.1295,0.243647,Anger

without her comments her perspective her voice the story loses most of its meaning.,0.11094,0.051917,0.12316,0.006856,0.78281,Sadness
In short the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk edgy seriocomic novel into a genteel art TV film and chose as her typical image one of Ms. Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy.,0.120386,0.223213,0.0766,0.037716,0.614268,Sadness

Some of that time is covered in the film as well.,0.07811,0.101342,0.07576,0.461158,0.148387,Joy

This is true of DECAMERON.,0.049257,0.05517,0.046457,0.585323,0.124005,Joy

Mind you I do have to give credit where credits due and Shu Qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action as it was her performance that shone through.,0.122596,0.135816,0.163352,0.016569,0.660424,Sadness

In short its no different from 90 of Hollywood product.,0.170303,0.064013,0.202432,0.022477,0.62601,Sadness

Posing as a celebration of sistahood the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating AficanAmerican gangsta stereotype.,0.169401,0.362974,0.09819,0.172605,0.196177,Disgust

I didnt think much of THE CRAFT and Im not into CHARMED either.,0.093389,0.094687,0.386175,0.05668,0.421021,Sadness
The only film I more or less enjoyed about teenage witches was LITTLE WITCHES 1996 and even that one wasnt very good.,0.092539,0.205388,0.509651,0.05767,0.216246,Fear

I was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80s movie about teenage witches in high school.,0.299825,0.118008,0.349865,0.049998,0.293102,Fear
But I was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious.,0.098666,0.108252,0.099987,0.27224,0.311839,Sadness
The acting is decent and serious all the time.,0.253966,0.161178,0.268411,0.143439,0.199525,Fear
No jokes are being played by teenagers or something.,0.126454,0.076379,0.158838,0.190874,0.378071,Sadness
And the musical score at first I thought was pretty good.,0.014696,0.021788,0.094928,0.640231,0.090657,Joy
It added some scariness and also something classy with the use of threatening violins and all.,0.212545,0.218282,0.454219,0.049577,0.190467,Fear
But as the movie progressed I came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious.,0.041185,0.018344,0.135133,0.471727,0.171203,Joy
They didnt have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speed.,0.29428,0.155766,0.45178,0.006051,0.27429,Fear
Then theres Melissa Sue Anderson who was the main reason for me to see this movie.,0.131362,0.127222,0.118705,0.097467,0.526109,Sadness
A few weeks ago I saw her in HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME a rather enjoyable thickplotted and goofy on some occasions slashermovie which she had done in the same year as MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS.,0.025847,0.008573,0.041945,0.839873,0.01808,Joy
And I must say she was very good as the icycold bad witch Vivian.,0.112862,0.156094,0.322264,0.032974,0.47478,Sadness
But the main problem with the movie is almost nothing happens Vivian causes a death and an accident yes but thats it.,0.078224,0.031273,0.251479,0.006734,0.714633,Sadness
Then theres Robin the good witch who is just learning about her powers.,0.065921,0.042849,0.158638,0.456677,0.130668,Joy
And we expect the two of them using their powers more than once but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles.,0.117074,0.504833,0.125767,0.127396,0.166463,Disgust
but nothing happens.,0.216652,0.100219,0.289896,0.046524,0.437328,Sadness
There is sort of a confrontation in the end but its a big disappointment.,0.055393,0.088417,0.110557,0.002335,0.817773,Sadness
So the acting of the two witches was good.,0.037894,0.065092,0.132685,0.395691,0.215399,Joy
The musical score was decent even though overly ambitious.,0.042172,0.072112,0.310444,0.233663,0.239563,Fear

Widmark is wonderful as usual.,0.108775,0.018851,0.036534,0.729851,0.019797,Joy

there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters and Clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is Telling instead of showing.,0.238878,0.299569,0.113315,0.008017,0.508111,Sadness
Thus at one point you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels because the script wouldnt allow him to act out his feelings.,0.477286,0.159895,0.074216,0.08476,0.285708,Anger

It hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrust.,0.1752,0.100089,0.105199,0.05784,0.605667,Sadness

It was of course totally superficial beautiful English country and seaside or not.,0.102401,0.065701,0.063946,0.466092,0.163297,Joy
The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part.,0.111332,0.266105,0.133942,0.003427,0.625701,Sadness
They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and lowcost heartstring elements.,0.034043,0.018289,0.146549,0.049258,0.742429,Sadness

I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece.,0.144445,0.123237,0.028277,0.481849,0.105934,Joy
I simply dont see the reasons why.,0.227063,0.137781,0.180587,0.030876,0.533376,Sadness
What I see are many flaws and a sample of them follows. 1 The three main characters are thrown at you and its very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.,0.14943,0.290135,0.098396,0.02446,0.556799,Sadness
2 The secondary characters are there just to fill the gaps but they dont add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.,0.196015,0.208648,0.14427,0.06953,0.456861,Sadness
3 I did not like how Tomas was impersonated.,0.280164,0.352925,0.160875,0.001048,0.409761,Sadness
Nothing is good for him.,0.12792,0.045097,0.51284,0.000518,0.43616,Fear
He is so selfcentered and selfish.,0.361833,0.355356,0.182049,0.02609,0.259749,Anger
He is not human in some sense.,0.209502,0.040485,0.308956,0.105916,0.351752,Sadness
But when his selfconfidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone I did not find the interpretation credible.,0.177263,0.041874,0.08342,0.004791,0.784686,Sadness
4 Its very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968.,0.31466,0.277177,0.091093,0.026595,0.439769,Sadness
On top of that the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions which sounds strange to me.,0.051716,0.060876,0.101268,0.508101,0.135405,Joy
And I am not even mother tongue.,0.06145,0.373905,0.033645,0.004326,0.653316,Sadness
Moreover the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech which I found very inconsistent.,0.041443,0.069942,0.060594,0.2816,0.399464,Sadness
7 I found the ending sort of trivial.,0.138641,0.213761,0.085846,0.085121,0.506573,Sadness
But they die after having realized that they are happy indeed.,0.001549,0.004834,0.078773,0.351662,0.374865,Sadness
So what Had they died unhappy would the message of the movie have been different I dont think so.,0.03636,0.021784,0.205711,0.005869,0.786197,Sadness
I considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.,0.242872,0.239164,0.136735,0.020734,0.503958,Sadness
8 The only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters.,0.137474,0.100439,0.077842,0.358909,0.207897,Joy
You see them for almost three hours but in the end you are left with nothing.,0.175772,0.13889,0.224105,0.018712,0.560416,Sadness
You dont feel empathy you dont relate to them you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say. 9 I hated the stop the music in the restaurant scene which some comments praised a lot.,0.184242,0.435502,0.072358,0.005294,0.474414,Sadness
Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction Why Franz agrees with her I really dont see the point.,0.222203,0.198877,0.106693,0.124399,0.372639,Sadness
The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality.,0.664496,0.059147,0.116978,0.046127,0.204774,Anger
Whats so special and unique about itAfter all these negative comments let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot thats why I gave it a two.,0.079377,0.254659,0.03289,0.067994,0.594819,Sadness

The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians.,0.224364,0.559947,0.124241,0.041149,0.200809,Disgust
Tereza pictures taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague are used to identify the people taking part to the riots.,0.196234,0.467577,0.23459,0.029564,0.239485,Disgust
I found it quite original and Terezas sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.,0.17278,0.078696,0.312038,0.027994,0.500266,Sadness
Finally there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally designed in such a way that Tomas types are going to like it and Tereza ones are going to hate it.,0.653619,0.085467,0.138348,0.082411,0.104263,Anger
If this is the case I strongly doubt it though then my comment should be revised drastically.,0.135168,0.180278,0.582899,0.002006,0.259258,Fear

but the plot was there one begins to meander and at one point completely loses it.,0.309227,0.077608,0.16634,0.015613,0.554819,Sadness
good ingredients in competent hands.,0.030654,0.069542,0.095043,0.656238,0.036209,Joy

The problem with the movie is Jack Lemmons Felix Ungar.,0.316899,0.063224,0.181154,0.192803,0.219786,Anger
Jack makes a very very honest effort at the role.,0.157257,0.058793,0.092884,0.488554,0.083263,Joy
The problem is that he makes Felix SO depressing and downtrodden that he becomes more annoying than comical.,0.49514,0.055741,0.041016,0.001124,0.549653,Sadness
Tony Randalls performance in the series brought the kind of humor warmth and sensitivity to Felixs character which Lemmons portrayal lacks.,0.06333,0.137079,0.068058,0.520152,0.088185,Joy
Tonys Felix Unger obviously could be annoying some of the time.,0.797272,0.145034,0.068382,0.005758,0.120478,Anger
However in the TV series it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline.,0.305582,0.190599,0.12613,0.015476,0.512397,Sadness
Jacks Felix Ungar note the different spelling in the movie seems to never be happy fun or interesting.,0.042804,0.010622,0.011416,0.62099,0.162175,Joy
The movie Felix Ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall all the time.,0.509226,0.174942,0.10038,0.173858,0.060982,Anger

The beginning 20 minutes are very boring.,0.253054,0.08949,0.12764,0.008035,0.646645,Sadness
The same issue occurs with Felixs conversation with the Pidgeon Sisters.,0.408585,0.170014,0.053707,0.069611,0.38593,Anger
The movies ending is predictable and too pat.,0.12933,0.102333,0.153792,0.192521,0.358927,Sadness
Theres very little care or compassion for each of them by the other.,0.132369,0.205394,0.263595,0.071237,0.39029,Sadness
The result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger rather than comedy unless you are watching the great scenes described above.,0.037747,0.177737,0.050222,0.014302,0.784433,Sadness
It appears that Jack Lemmons monotone persona of Felix brings the film down rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters.,0.034639,0.138251,0.185014,0.480004,0.041636,Joy

I still vividly remember the film especially the performance of Robert Taylor.,0.054199,0.208964,0.097942,0.264561,0.278829,Sadness
I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid almost dull leading man type and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks.,0.056689,0.486558,0.06621,0.15095,0.230012,Disgust
This film however proved what an interesting actor he could be.,0.128512,0.0982,0.102488,0.3738,0.176521,Joy
He did not get enough roles like this during his long career.,0.236431,0.174118,0.111912,0.009457,0.60962,Sadness
This is his best performance.,0.006818,0.024671,0.013599,0.836656,0.044928,Joy
He is totally believable in a truly villainous role.,0.129849,0.309152,0.178972,0.256172,0.084125,Disgust
From what I have read he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles.,0.118441,0.211472,0.247849,0.106005,0.345232,Sadness
He basically would just do what MGM gave him.,0.207574,0.233784,0.246565,0.07233,0.33029,Sadness
This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles.,0.15772,0.436086,0.24606,0.00972,0.332768,Disgust
The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolans character was.,0.515576,0.302349,0.117955,0.047071,0.171596,Anger
Nolan was a great actor but this character really aggravated me.,0.101058,0.038109,0.06732,0.463924,0.183192,Joy

I happened to spot this flick on the shelf under new releases and found the idea of a hiphop zombie flick far too interesting to pass up.,0.087577,0.049124,0.132555,0.401406,0.186373,Joy
Thats how it was billed on the box anyhow and I thought to myself What a great idea Plus theres a Welcome to Oakland sign on the cover too.,0.039549,0.02405,0.092939,0.672616,0.052833,Joy
How could I resist Unfortunately the hiphop part only lasted for as long as the opening theme.,0.025704,0.14502,0.168322,0.016108,0.712,Sadness
Neither hiphop music nor hiphop culture had much of a role in the movie.,0.091792,0.170668,0.131656,0.227057,0.303417,Sadness
Having lived in Oakland myself I know that there are many aspiring hiphop artists there so the low budget of this flick was no excuse not to have a fitting soundtrack.,0.133445,0.450302,0.156348,0.037693,0.354731,Disgust

Why the Quiroz Brothers didnt take advantage of this is beyond me.,0.211741,0.392518,0.20108,0.087387,0.209878,Disgust
Once the film got rolling it was a completely typical zombie movie with a cast that just so happened to be completely black and Latino.,0.211537,0.224838,0.111278,0.109763,0.382888,Sadness
You might think that this would put an unusual slant on the movie.,0.340403,0.176867,0.266468,0.09201,0.214066,Anger
but it didnt.,0.171227,0.131477,0.172706,0.172181,0.321531,Sadness
Somehow the Quiroz Brothers vision of urban culture boils down to driveby shootings and dropping an Fbomb in every line in the movie.,0.49306,0.196369,0.070925,0.011377,0.394567,Anger
The rapidfire use of the word fuck is probably this movies most distinguishing characteristics.,0.446588,0.301412,0.125737,0.029386,0.274424,Anger
there were single lines that contained the word three or four times and no line didnt contain it at least once.,0.111822,0.224095,0.129719,0.026255,0.608118,Sadness
The film was generally a disappointment.,0.094082,0.113202,0.14599,0.006877,0.729772,Sadness
It would have been interesting to see a genuinely urban culture zombie flick but Hood of the Living Dead doesnt deliver on that count.,0.448563,0.212459,0.096735,0.070349,0.27188,Anger

There was no distinct flavor to the movie.,0.084156,0.076166,0.102581,0.398616,0.198121,Joy
Its just another runofthemill low budget flick with bad acting lousy writing amateurish direction bland cinematography a cheap soundtrack and nothing at all to recommend it.,0.281906,0.469912,0.129912,0.001338,0.329434,Disgust

Pimlico is or at least was in the forties a predominantly workingclass district of London set on the North Bank of the Thames about a mile from Victoria station.,0.091821,0.072387,0.13666,0.05685,0.659264,Sadness
It is not quite correct to say as has often been said that the film is about Pimlico declaring itself independent of Britain.,0.123318,0.243832,0.237608,0.145288,0.261317,Sadness
What happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by King Edward IV to the Duchy of Burgundy.,0.13432,0.211596,0.185887,0.067931,0.463431,Sadness

I suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with Pimlico remaining independent as a British version of Monaco or San Marino.,0.134435,0.264543,0.38261,0.037233,0.308347,Fear
Indeed I suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a TV sitcom rather than a film.,0.131286,0.295666,0.421681,0.011562,0.308411,Fear
In 1949 however four years after the end of the war the filmmakers were keen stress patriotism and British identity so the film ends with Pimlico being reabsorbed into Britain.,0.127936,0.136487,0.535016,0.014791,0.308742,Fear
One of the bestknown lines from the film is We always were English and we always will be English and its just because we ARE English that were sticking up for our right to be Burgundians.,0.432684,0.089749,0.085534,0.183038,0.194842,Anger

I find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of todays pornography it was very tastefully done.,0.065541,0.131237,0.275218,0.018774,0.594947,Sadness

I also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s.,0.092701,0.256437,0.088297,0.196913,0.318591,Sadness
My only complaint about the film was the running time there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been.,0.202432,0.371089,0.057692,0.001435,0.541563,Sadness

Also the ending was pretty tame and I was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie Pages life where the film left off.,0.209997,0.172818,0.081009,0.07015,0.522845,Sadness

The idea of Robbie Coltrane reteaming with Jimmy McGovern for another TV movie about Fitz filled me with absolute glee.,0.149005,0.279096,0.020704,0.192611,0.323265,Sadness
Ill start with the good.,0.058898,0.028878,0.218627,0.340748,0.209571,Joy
One of the many things that impressed me about the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was defined as a character.,0.138944,0.097591,0.181103,0.161397,0.374645,Sadness
You could feel him clicking in your mind the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer.,0.048876,0.012679,0.063136,0.574849,0.147678,Joy
Coltrane of course remained great throughout the show but I always felt that some of the later episodes  those not written by McGovern  mistreated the character.,0.143405,0.034084,0.198108,0.234946,0.292312,Sadness
So the good news is this Fitz is back.,0.010366,0.013261,0.080516,0.732903,0.052705,Joy
As soon as you see him in this show  making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughters wedding  youll feel that click once again.,0.220831,0.446442,0.082569,0.058066,0.304446,Disgust

The problem I do have with this movie revolves around the crime Fitz is trying to solve.,0.3056,0.131877,0.137714,0.026413,0.522669,Sadness
In standard Cracker fashion we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes  the suspense lies in seeing Fitz figure it out.,0.181897,0.615753,0.099933,0.054496,0.166557,Disgust

Instead the Americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion.,0.183879,0.409632,0.105186,0.052772,0.365318,Disgust
Theyre knownothing loudmouths who complain about everything treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives  one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes.,0.412169,0.44184,0.127762,0.001786,0.245272,Disgust
I honestly thought Id mistakenly switched channels or something.,0.219713,0.079887,0.024704,0.017279,0.744174,Sadness
But it doesnt stop there.,0.307796,0.326916,0.162019,0.153248,0.1026,Disgust

I cant say that this ruined the show for me  its was still good TV better than almost everything else in the genre mainly due to once again Coltrane.,0.213616,0.044357,0.066932,0.016431,0.739201,Sadness

I dont think so.,0.097929,0.161231,0.472436,0.017951,0.370255,Fear

These are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche.,0.074996,0.117079,0.206573,0.256182,0.25016,Joy
What a relief therefore that John Dahl a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action directed this nuanced noirish thriller.,0.195903,0.073302,0.189512,0.329221,0.116405,Joy
The plot twists are topnotch and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains.,0.105231,0.081618,0.126985,0.461187,0.099741,Joy

Usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired.,0.134503,0.141204,0.127475,0.291669,0.216455,Joy
Surprisingly the writing wasnt bad either.,0.17048,0.329989,0.159317,0.049207,0.395935,Sadness

Bottom line to all Ive said is that this movie is worth watching because of the cast and writing in dealing with a pretty flimsy idea for a movie.,0.111751,0.081304,0.042751,0.37957,0.244034,Joy
But it was the 50s and anything was possible from intruders from outer space to mole men from inner space.,0.183287,0.308441,0.245693,0.064095,0.299596,Disgust
It is definitely worth seeing there isnt a bad actor in the group.,0.067556,0.256644,0.063768,0.412464,0.093737,Joy

Peter Jacksons versions are better films overall from objective point of view.,0.089921,0.119779,0.062367,0.405716,0.189912,Joy
That being said they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings and let me explain why.,0.340495,0.375783,0.064601,0.020161,0.37446,Disgust
Firstly the acting of the onscreen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with Jacksons LOTR.,0.171856,0.178658,0.145583,0.192819,0.275294,Sadness
The whole cast is too run of the mill.,0.119378,0.134844,0.184949,0.17518,0.342274,Sadness
Are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask.,0.111585,0.144855,0.117152,0.126558,0.485365,Sadness
Well they are not really sillysave for Hobbits later about them and they certainly pack more personality than Jacksons party  even with much more limited dialogue time.,0.232987,0.150057,0.1934,0.065676,0.427147,Sadness
And that is because of superior voice acting of the Bakshis LOTR.,0.095577,0.032784,0.097154,0.436558,0.194364,Joy
Take Aragorn for example.,0.493532,0.294768,0.13826,0.025148,0.232372,Anger
In this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authorityAragorn the lordand with a seasoned raspAragorn the ranger.,0.089299,0.122304,0.154675,0.073045,0.574075,Sadness
This is due to John Hurts brilliant voice acting.,0.180704,0.028886,0.215246,0.021258,0.633617,Sadness
Compare that to Viggo Mortensens rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven Hurt beats Mortensen hands down.,0.100266,0.255676,0.327612,0.0025,0.471872,Sadness
And then there is Gandalf.,0.170634,0.135146,0.16701,0.182064,0.309168,Sadness
Probably the most dominatingand the most popular character in the whole saga.,0.107024,0.237718,0.239375,0.109513,0.338591,Sadness
In this Bakshi version GandalfWilliam Squire is a real wizard.,0.071712,0.194526,0.282959,0.032202,0.507383,Sadness
And by that I dont mean he shoots bolts from his fingertipshe does not but his presence is just captivating.,0.212708,0.12691,0.083157,0.191411,0.341414,Sadness
He is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease.,0.057757,0.379584,0.240144,0.204317,0.095556,Disgust
Add to that his looks Tall old as the ancient oak beard long as his body sharp eyes wizardy hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat.,0.15057,0.61918,0.117008,0.026623,0.22895,Disgust
A Perfect Gandalf just like in the books.,0.035101,0.009453,0.005128,0.785336,0.070691,Joy
Ian McKellens Gandalf in the other hand is simply just too boring.,0.151471,0.129116,0.102664,0.103439,0.512203,Sadness
He looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword.,0.098031,0.648174,0.037662,0.122203,0.116913,Disgust
Yes a sword.,0.120864,0.050585,0.086481,0.403181,0.199134,Joy
In this Bakshi version Gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his swordas he did in the books.,0.280677,0.137303,0.238251,0.006647,0.496812,Sadness
And those are stylish slow motion kills.,0.30558,0.084497,0.21384,0.003891,0.543564,Sadness
Gandalf is not a power to be messed with.,0.31206,0.356069,0.346126,0.003565,0.207981,Disgust
And it must be noted that while Im sad to say this the great Christopher Lee didnt bring Saruman alive.,0.018144,0.092442,0.075198,0.035656,0.788176,Sadness
Fraser Kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and lines.,0.229581,0.180771,0.027548,0.022921,0.642156,Sadness
Before I move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the Orcs are also superior to Jacksons pretendeous bad guys.,0.212006,0.346462,0.154637,0.031571,0.40206,Sadness
Bakshis orcs taunt their enemiesor each other constantly with growls screams and nasty language.,0.581622,0.29443,0.246037,0.001463,0.107348,Anger
They are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion.,0.19764,0.240326,0.11921,0.179164,0.251044,Sadness
And finally the Black Riders  or the Nazgul.,0.107359,0.069611,0.07234,0.54323,0.084571,Joy
Those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one  not just some riders wearing black.,0.102697,0.091828,0.812913,0.001443,0.102588,Fear
And they speak with haunting voice which mesmerizes their victim.,0.085042,0.126539,0.455371,0.017226,0.421732,Fear
My favorite scene in the film is when the Nazgul are chasing Frodo near the river.,0.131869,0.182758,0.105092,0.285774,0.211898,Joy
While Peter Jackson couldnt do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party Bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky.,0.251747,0.279721,0.075516,0.145532,0.269199,Disgust
But as much I like this film more than Jacksons the latter are if only technically still better.,0.087367,0.13138,0.071116,0.424803,0.157943,Joy
And that is because of some key visuals.,0.206658,0.012094,0.125338,0.431524,0.101341,Joy
As you know Bakshi LOTR features a mixture of animated charactersall hobbits and the main cast and real actors covered with paint.,0.084782,0.098141,0.107985,0.124881,0.541007,Sadness
I dont really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just dont fit very well with traditional cartoon figures.,0.269508,0.200728,0.124419,0.010496,0.547314,Sadness
This is especially true with humansRiders of Rohan tavern people etc.  Orcs are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters.,0.178901,0.241963,0.069977,0.188949,0.299418,Sadness
Orcs while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to Jacksons version.,0.034326,0.288217,0.063523,0.362277,0.145281,Joy
They have brownishgreen skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth.,0.228364,0.514883,0.060374,0.069628,0.234647,Disgust
Biggest screw up in this films visuals howerver are the Hobbits.,0.111961,0.334412,0.353618,0.067358,0.228229,Fear
While I prefer almost every character in Bakshi version compared to Jackson the latter has clearly superior Hobbits in fact they are perfect.,0.055065,0.181901,0.035755,0.335517,0.268342,Joy
With Bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid Disney bambies.,0.269127,0.190603,0.220344,0.069275,0.340807,Sadness
And you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned.,0.358762,0.258557,0.274287,0.032838,0.246213,Anger
Again the voice acting is OK with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels.,0.245911,0.12004,0.230808,0.01345,0.528747,Sadness
Well I never really liked those halflings anyway.,0.220749,0.043325,0.205447,0.011516,0.62868,Sadness
General failures in the Bakshi script are well known.,0.137516,0.206082,0.461388,0.02795,0.292966,Fear
Limited playing timewith limited budget and a lot of missing scenes.,0.107789,0.10766,0.114043,0.001199,0.771768,Sadness
So while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesnt do it in extensive detail compared to Jacksons version.,0.05794,0.523254,0.142382,0.047306,0.325965,Disgust
Ill give it a score of 8 out of 10.,0.090014,0.020504,0.507288,0.082564,0.303253,Fear

Are there holes in it Of course.,0.301745,0.252424,0.104926,0.039119,0.434138,Sadness
probably a number of them and a reason you see so many critical comments.,0.109535,0.289256,0.396648,0.022562,0.328381,Fear
However it is unfairly bashed here.,0.627484,0.160388,0.034468,0.147138,0.055487,Anger

When people say that Vonnegut is unfilmable two things come to my mind.,0.136615,0.20515,0.092864,0.186875,0.3374,Sadness
One is that many of his themes are very near the knuckle or even taboo despite the accusation sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively easy targets for his satire.,0.235974,0.431874,0.073759,0.055748,0.314519,Disgust

This is a clever premise.,0.15748,0.125177,0.139553,0.245423,0.260386,Sadness

Connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones.,0.077252,0.05902,0.135369,0.28482,0.317739,Sadness

Well I cant imagine anyone liking this movie because its just bad bad bad.,0.212791,0.188717,0.259278,0.002746,0.504334,Sadness
Its obvious that whoever made this movie doesnt know a single thing about horror.,0.035967,0.213142,0.706084,0.006619,0.161602,Fear
The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres action movie guns and criminals and horror living scarecrows.,0.017178,0.456871,0.527772,0.044653,0.067117,Fear
Wheres the horror in that I wanted the criminals to die horrible painful deaths.,0.012227,0.141066,0.517099,2e-05,0.446775,Fear
But the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres which could have been original if handle well NEVER gels.,0.14766,0.201443,0.172214,0.013901,0.593437,Sadness
Were simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows which are alive for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up.,0.230957,0.45666,0.102814,0.057715,0.272378,Disgust
This part was really BAD.,0.157949,0.212388,0.230309,0.004178,0.550679,Sadness
The director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea I cant tell you how annoying that was.,0.775818,0.181784,0.059421,0.002195,0.139338,Anger
As Ive already mentioned the criminals in SCARECROWS are amazingly stupid.,0.274596,0.349758,0.20849,0.004703,0.366353,Sadness
Get a freaking clue morons.,0.68832,0.265275,0.09722,0.007593,0.130107,Anger

When she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow cross she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene bad acting even though the criminals couldnt have done it.,0.162308,0.753562,0.10341,0.000256,0.148386,Disgust
What a dimwit she was But the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick.,0.197116,0.211713,0.263465,0.004251,0.486399,Sadness
Theyre not scary.,0.104442,0.046755,0.757896,0.035331,0.109035,Fear

Theyre just a plot device in this plot device filled movie.,0.198519,0.049019,0.022173,0.175717,0.476027,Sadness
Mr Wesley filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop doesnt elicit anything but sheer boredom.,0.133556,0.283642,0.251791,0.023011,0.440533,Sadness

To believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the antebellum south.,0.279141,0.666639,0.078366,0.017681,0.13446,Disgust
Totally absurd  I wonder how they got a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell who being southern knows better to participate in this crap.,0.217256,0.108701,0.165252,0.213426,0.246723,Sadness

That might be a western first.,0.130178,0.063927,0.23241,0.373036,0.092506,Joy
Even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal still youve got to give the director some effort for trying a western first.,0.257586,0.070837,0.482172,0.010024,0.325067,Fear
Maybe that was what the makers of this film were going for.,0.200301,0.261191,0.291237,0.07512,0.263191,Fear
Orginality especially with an all African woman cast and an oriental cowgirl.,0.119205,0.412261,0.071773,0.149597,0.259195,Disgust

Yokai Daisenso is a childrens film by Takashi Miike but as you might expect its probably a bit too dark  scary for younger ones.,0.067404,0.127875,0.796889,0.031495,0.047715,Fear
However older children may well eat this up that is if you play it dubbed in English.,0.074979,0.214198,0.153066,0.314858,0.153277,Joy
The story is that of a young boy who has moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after a divorce.,0.201794,0.259538,0.022743,0.037764,0.577212,Sadness

The look and feel of the film is great the effects are entertaining and some of the humor will just sail right over kids heads but still older ones might enjoy it.,0.014055,0.0379,0.042324,0.769246,0.044074,Joy

the music makes Oasis seem like The Beatles.,0.054134,0.045873,0.040322,0.426156,0.271235,Joy
During the studio recordings the duo  Strumpet  change lyrics in every take and Ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it and quite absurdly they do take it.,0.234764,0.121341,0.234716,0.106347,0.337846,Sadness

The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzches work and personality psychoanalytical techniques and Viennas history.,0.236074,0.11178,0.312545,0.178598,0.149084,Fear
Audience please stay away.,0.216808,0.10004,0.244888,0.029553,0.516373,Sadness
This film is definitely a product of its times and seen in any other context it is an incredibly stupid movie.,0.389405,0.088977,0.100808,0.214729,0.170524,Anger
Heck even seen in its proper context its pretty bad Mostly this is due to a silly plot and very selfindulgent direction by the famed Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni.,0.192592,0.240324,0.109872,0.02004,0.566507,Sadness
In this case he tried to meld a very artsy style film with an antiestablishment hippie film and only succeeded in producing a bomb of gargantuan proportions.,0.115238,0.284746,0.17304,0.224255,0.168083,Disgust
The film begins with a rap session where a lot of with it students sit around saying such platitudes as power to the people and complaining about the man.,0.222495,0.778892,0.050541,0.015272,0.079648,Disgust
Considering most of these hippies have parents sending them to college it seemed a bit silly for these privileged kids to be complaining so loudly and shouting revolutionary jargon.,0.32252,0.48538,0.049155,0.023398,0.295473,Disgust
A bit later violence between the students and the establishment pigs breaks out and a cop is killed.,0.417861,0.38113,0.2815,0.000499,0.162043,Anger

As they gyrate about in the dust suddenly other couples appear from no where and there is a huge orgy scene.,0.094007,0.346867,0.455527,0.008675,0.264621,Fear
While you see a bit of skin warranting an Rrating its not as explicit as it could have been.,0.18937,0.228317,0.116972,0.124424,0.363833,Sadness
In fact it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just boggles the mind.,0.047218,0.113634,0.117052,0.016147,0.769353,Sadness
And of course when they are finished the many many other couples vanish into thin air.,0.133564,0.145292,0.257879,0.275892,0.118565,Joy
Oddly later the couple paint the plane with some help and it looks a lot like a Peter Max creation.,0.096613,0.066996,0.157837,0.377227,0.16994,Joy
Despite improving the look of the plane the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary.,0.278451,0.320628,0.141378,0.158386,0.136832,Disgust
Instead of one simple explosion you see the same enormous house explode about 8 times.,0.48609,0.052329,0.116536,0.149485,0.202283,Anger
Then inexplicably you see TVs refrigerators and other things explode in slow motion.,0.561957,0.113967,0.083559,0.021773,0.35662,Anger
While dumb it is rather cool to watchsort of like when David Letterman blows things up or smashes things on his show.,0.245489,0.067986,0.354535,0.032139,0.405635,Sadness
Aside from a dopey plot the film suffers from a strong need for a single likable character as well as extensive editing.,0.057271,0.092284,0.250922,0.040259,0.60041,Sadness
At least 15 minutes could easily be removed to speed things up a bitespecially since there really isnt all that much plot or dialog.,0.222906,0.158562,0.237722,0.005048,0.530183,Sadness
The bottom line is that this is an incredibly dumb film and I was not surprised to see it listed in The Fifty Worst Films book by Harry Medved.,0.337944,0.37632,0.037083,0.006729,0.429487,Sadness
Its a well deserved addition to this pantheon of crap.,0.41887,0.084184,0.327258,0.006943,0.336595,Anger

There are a few things that derail this film.,0.100129,0.420614,0.171881,0.2121,0.078185,Disgust
First Tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals.,0.1276,0.273542,0.124432,0.295453,0.115206,Joy
In my opinion any footwear on Tarzan whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed takes away from the character which is supposed to be anticivilization and projungle.,0.281743,0.236213,0.149562,0.008539,0.494836,Sadness
Second the character of Benji as mentioned in a previous post totally derails the movie as the comic foil.,0.178534,0.269911,0.197492,0.230439,0.104414,Disgust
To me his character is unnecessary to the films plot.,0.192951,0.239195,0.132439,0.215975,0.194689,Disgust
Also while Weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as Tarzan its apparent that he was not in his best shape.,0.051507,0.087199,0.045731,0.493993,0.174013,Joy

Likewise the battle which takes only 30 seconds tops would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and His Mate.,0.153944,0.152804,0.154731,0.192423,0.307522,Sadness

But here he is not heroic.,0.114019,0.099984,0.102403,0.402981,0.161901,Joy

His actual performance in the Shakespearian role of Othello is not great but bearable.,0.2607,0.135107,0.081144,0.220487,0.256709,Anger

Paul Robesons brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place.,0.055526,0.03248,0.033805,0.62424,0.11794,Joy

All three white actors did the role in black face.,0.124098,0.4896,0.124323,0.026334,0.377174,Disgust
My personal favorite of the three is Welles who seems the most subtle.,0.132014,0.042418,0.078793,0.258929,0.372696,Sadness
But even watching Welles fine film version makes me angry that Robeson never got to put his performance with Jose Ferrer as Iago on film.,0.644353,0.332938,0.027717,0.014897,0.159439,Anger

Some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set.,0.194313,0.098335,0.120142,0.289035,0.211619,Joy

There was an earlier movie in the 1930s in which an actor playing Othello gets jealous of his wife I think the title was MEN ARE NOT GODS but Im not sure.,0.117276,0.143335,0.085523,0.007572,0.745469,Sadness
But due to Colmans name and career and Cukors directing it is A DOUBLE LIFE that people think of when they recall this plot idea.,0.163867,0.139141,0.04802,0.138209,0.487423,Sadness
Only Diane is aware of the personality problem of the exconvict and cant delay the production long enough she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play.,0.141046,0.132773,0.228304,0.014291,0.596587,Sadness

Dressed to Kill is somewhat important historically.,0.373531,0.132189,0.20568,0.098831,0.257746,Anger

Its odd then that director Brian De Palma was basically trying to crib Hitchcock.,0.17392,0.141525,0.135477,0.204428,0.301008,Sadness
For example De Palma literally lifts parts of Vertigo 1958 for Dressed to Kills infamous museum scene.,0.221231,0.618835,0.101357,0.00545,0.241714,Disgust
Dressed to Kills shower scenes as well as its villain and method of death have similarities to Psycho 1960.,0.445952,0.31508,0.152085,0.021871,0.257923,Anger
De Palma also employs a prominent score with recurrent motifs in the style of Hitchcocks favorite composer Bernard Herrmann.,0.029655,0.01739,0.127958,0.586425,0.093867,Joy
The similarities do not end there.,0.157824,0.136381,0.216102,0.15621,0.323379,Sadness
Maybe partially because of this influence Dressed to Kill is also deeply flawed when viewed at this point in time.,0.291618,0.225525,0.114414,0.040597,0.446233,Sadness
One aspect of the film that unfortunately hasnt been improved is Dressed to Kills sex and nudity scenes.,0.104915,0.536894,0.080048,0.008421,0.423248,Disgust

So from my perspective its lamentable that Dressed to Kills emphasis on flesh and its pleasures is one of the few aspects in which others have not strongly followed suit or trumped the film.,0.096215,0.758052,0.093033,0.022114,0.138341,Disgust
Perhaps it has been desired but they have not been allowed to follow suit because of cultural controls from conservative stuffed shirts.,0.265695,0.16101,0.237391,0.210393,0.113294,Anger
De Palmas direction of cinematography and the staging of some scenes are also good enough that it is difficult to do something in the same style better than De Palma does it.,0.041218,0.053776,0.069407,0.61866,0.087755,Joy
He has an odd characteristic approach to closeups and hes fond of shots from interesting angles such as overhead views and James Whalelike tracking across distant cutaways in the sets.,0.090403,0.063556,0.298206,0.198555,0.274495,Fear

Once the first murder occurs things improve but because of the films eventual influence much of the improvement now seems a bit clichd and occasionally hokey.,0.189816,0.364467,0.147554,0.145674,0.18771,Disgust
The performances are mostly good although Michael Caine is underused and Dickinson has to exit sooner than wed like but the exit is necessary and very effective.,0.07268,0.057409,0.043524,0.469252,0.202567,Joy
Dressed to Kill is at least likely to hold your interest until the end but because of facts not contained in the picture itself hasnt exactly aged well.,0.148033,0.071649,0.242595,0.002868,0.651033,Sadness
At this point it is perhaps best to watch the film primarily as a historical relic and as an examplebut not the best even for that eraof some of De Palmas directorial flair.,0.086851,0.119746,0.035073,0.515567,0.118721,Joy

First off the film was intended for children much like the original show was.,0.093741,0.427999,0.065157,0.259438,0.102767,Disgust
However Gerry Anderson treated us like adults and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for childrens programming.,0.151765,0.186523,0.083387,0.325691,0.167551,Joy
This on the other hand dumbs down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the Spy Kids franchise.,0.434188,0.290085,0.045101,0.17542,0.084746,Anger
The final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the Thunderbirds series and children while missing both entirely.,0.07677,0.117804,0.173727,0.007477,0.71704,Sadness
Lame jokes cartoonish sounds and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie and Im sure that Jonathan Frakes is wishing hed never directed this.,0.248039,0.170351,0.161097,0.005826,0.569976,Sadness
Over all everyone gave a solid performance considering the script that they were all given.,0.153003,0.166657,0.145529,0.369053,0.076706,Joy
Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood playing the part extremely well.,0.034324,0.156525,0.113939,0.235825,0.355481,Sadness
My only complaint about the characters is about The Hoods henchmen who are reduced to leftovers from old Looney Tunes cartoons bumbling about as amazingly enough the kids take them on with ease.,0.36006,0.332711,0.245035,0.046748,0.171844,Anger
Whats odd about this movie is that while I was watching the movie I had fun.,0.04644,0.024939,0.013893,0.647487,0.129649,Joy
But once the lights went up I realized that the movie was fairly bad I was 8 lighter and two hours of my time were now gone.,0.107649,0.13199,0.176232,0.040993,0.60339,Sadness
A guilty pleasure Perhaps.,0.389922,0.182488,0.033726,0.265887,0.090614,Anger
Nonetheless Thunderbirds is a forgettable mess.,0.333636,0.339749,0.436065,0.000794,0.125582,Fear
Instead of a big go Im going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie.,0.135292,0.146202,0.210425,0.060845,0.498543,Sadness
If the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it it would have been an incredible film worthy of the Thunderbirds name.,0.056224,0.290121,0.03913,0.412876,0.095135,Joy
However we get a movie that only diehard Thunderbirds fans if youd like to watch your childhood torn to pieces or the extremely bored should bother with.,0.135365,0.306485,0.026804,0.005079,0.660317,Sadness

Lincoln marks the first film of the directorstar collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda.,0.182604,0.192965,0.095311,0.36821,0.078637,Joy
I recall years ago Fonda telling that as a young actor he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and scared he wouldnt live up to the challenge.,0.013,0.052851,0.697991,0.008742,0.295197,Fear
John Ford before the shooting starts put him at ease by saying he wasnt going to be playing the Great Emancipator but just a jackleg prairie lawyer.,0.200486,0.364353,0.194256,0.069795,0.272543,Disgust
That being settled Fonda headed a cast that John Ford directed into a classic film.,0.177022,0.26551,0.146535,0.202089,0.188837,Disgust
This is not a biographical film of Lincoln.,0.145247,0.258531,0.124387,0.271505,0.14242,Joy
That had come before in the sound era with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln Raymond Massey did the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois.,0.058752,0.066612,0.055254,0.61297,0.082294,Joy
Massey still remains the definitive Lincoln.,0.180275,0.164386,0.119153,0.105414,0.446437,Sadness
But as Ford said Fonda wasnt playing the Great Emancipator just a small town lawyer in Illinois.,0.13951,0.280509,0.21412,0.16175,0.207507,Disgust
The film encompasses about 10 years of Lincolns early life.,0.041007,0.098862,0.064417,0.592413,0.07884,Joy
We see him clerking in a general store getting some law books from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he would cross again later in the story.,0.118956,0.191122,0.123465,0.25394,0.242039,Joy
And his romance with Ann Rutledge with her early death leaving Lincoln a most melancholy being.,0.153491,0.083066,0.241473,0.007029,0.628576,Sadness
Fast forward about 10 years and Lincoln is now a practicing attorney beginning to get some notice.,0.046993,0.088026,0.150723,0.388477,0.184668,Joy

This is where the bulk of the action takes place.,0.185503,0.178511,0.241029,0.208214,0.161559,Fear
The two sons of that family hed gotten the law books from way back when are accused of murder.,0.606848,0.328748,0.027389,0.017288,0.202045,Anger
He offers to defend them.,0.178222,0.564788,0.028859,0.024478,0.346041,Disgust
And not an ordinary murder but one of a deputy sheriff.,0.357574,0.501661,0.127801,0.017071,0.201846,Disgust
The trial itself is fiction but the gambit used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan who played the two sons is based on a real case Lincoln defended.,0.111669,0.443051,0.102636,0.06676,0.356557,Disgust
Ill say no more.,0.136529,0.09188,0.234284,0.003727,0.653013,Sadness
Other than the performances the great strength of Young Mr. Lincoln is the way John Ford captures the mood and atmosphere and setting of a small Illinois prairie town in a Fourth of July celebration.,0.038791,0.037326,0.026637,0.709732,0.07598,Joy
Its almost like youre watching a newsreel.,0.116929,0.182444,0.128602,0.168176,0.370712,Sadness
And it was the mood of the country itself young vibrant and growing.,0.269404,0.098862,0.018879,0.142904,0.446893,Sadness
Fans of John Ford films will recognize two musical themes here that were repeated in later films.,0.053779,0.508106,0.041199,0.195169,0.164279,Disgust
Lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and dramatists because of two reasons I believe.,0.058781,0.013067,0.014574,0.47079,0.265374,Joy
The first is hes the living embodiment of our own American mythology about people rising from the very bottom to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts.,0.229625,0.358404,0.090939,0.120068,0.253814,Disgust
In fact Young Mr. Lincoln very graphically shows the background Lincoln came from.,0.069791,0.060588,0.195858,0.390624,0.147658,Joy
His assassination assured his place in history.,0.124129,0.143697,0.323987,0.044654,0.44145,Sadness
Besides Fonda and others Ive mentioned special praise should also go to Fred Kohler Jr. and Ward Bond the two town louts Kohler being the murder victim and Bond the chief accuser.,0.105048,0.487937,0.086801,0.066806,0.333559,Disgust
Also Donald Meek as the prosecuting attorney and Alice Brady in what turned out to be her last film as the pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan.,0.178209,0.434115,0.075769,0.039251,0.396613,Disgust
And a very nice performance by Spencer Charters who specialized in rustic characters as the judge.,0.058802,0.085632,0.024631,0.559147,0.134052,Joy
For a film that captures the drama and romance of the time its set in you cant do better than Young Mr. I liked nearly all the movies in the Dirty Harry series with the exception of the one I think is titled Enforcer.,0.244599,0.290094,0.045743,0.06988,0.428868,Sadness
Deadpool was a bit weak in areas too but I still enjoyed it.,0.356914,0.157114,0.09772,0.069516,0.402328,Sadness
This one is one of my favorites of the series if nothing else for the great line of Go ahead make my day.,0.055239,0.002845,0.044572,0.625251,0.128393,Joy
This one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong.,0.281856,0.133077,0.057768,0.00707,0.653998,Sadness
Just think Magnum Force with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot.,0.18786,0.498736,0.313124,0.0019,0.210436,Disgust
Granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park.,0.055771,0.010701,0.065128,0.735756,0.034659,Joy
It also features Dirty Harry getting a bulldog as a gift and it tripping up Sandra Locke in a rather humorous scene.,0.083668,0.290291,0.017685,0.211455,0.334524,Sadness
The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress Sandra Locke in so many of his movies.,0.201599,0.161039,0.212068,0.162456,0.256481,Sadness
She brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me.,0.07249,0.075657,0.063668,0.479165,0.164535,Joy
Granted she is not to bad here but her character could have been so much better by someone else.,0.088645,0.290389,0.174723,0.197441,0.21605,Disgust
Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies at times they almost seem to be advertisements for guns.,0.119002,0.650376,0.077345,0.001381,0.316593,Disgust

Bait aint perfect.,0.158861,0.151647,0.229197,0.149047,0.302782,Sadness
It suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness.,0.082824,0.078702,0.246253,0.00412,0.682039,Sadness
But overall this movie worked.,0.091433,0.087104,0.225788,0.245281,0.257527,Sadness
All the elements aligned just right and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film.,0.101362,0.53415,0.1503,0.099743,0.171139,Disgust
Most of that I think is due to Jamie Foxx.,0.16673,0.072593,0.198955,0.056944,0.5547,Sadness
I dont know who tagged Foxx for the lead but whoever it was did this movie a big favor.,0.115831,0.270259,0.214543,0.043153,0.457827,Sadness
Believable and amazingly likeable Foxx glides through the movie smooth as butter and funnier than hell.,0.099718,0.171391,0.036207,0.536634,0.051204,Joy
You can tell hes working on instinct and instinct doesnt fail him.,0.227105,0.103229,0.20004,0.030217,0.539281,Sadness
The plot while unimportant actually ties together pretty well and theres even a character arc through which Foxxs character grows as a person.,0.098125,0.120789,0.024295,0.477439,0.15195,Joy
Again they couldve slipped by without any of this but it just makes things that much better.,0.087834,0.070754,0.243198,0.18786,0.335223,Sadness
Im surprised at the low rating for this.,0.142171,0.416739,0.221256,0.00482,0.390882,Disgust

I am not.,0.178829,0.124928,0.183717,0.154549,0.3387,Sadness

The premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was Jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong.,0.308049,0.117403,0.085749,0.126251,0.37796,Sadness
One scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal and then the character goes on to say that it was Jesus who taught us this.,0.332648,0.37149,0.040674,0.005032,0.440547,Sadness

I wouldnt want to let my viewers down. 2 I will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out its only a dream.,0.213764,0.25022,0.113958,0.129289,0.320133,Sadness
I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes.,0.103643,0.527763,0.057666,0.009645,0.448025,Disgust
And considering the movie was only like an hour long the dreamtomovielength ratio was quite high.,0.123511,0.137696,0.106962,0.2547,0.289154,Sadness

This is a film that on the surface would seem to be all about J.

But if this film was aiming for B status as I suspect it was for a number of reasons which Ill touch on in a sec then it failed magnificently.,0.188996,0.220268,0.406953,0.001847,0.363718,Fear
Not only did it shoot for B and miss it landed somewhere around F. This film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts.,0.11955,0.026742,0.065866,0.006616,0.842623,Sadness
I say above that its likely this film was aiming for B status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror which can either be very good or very bad.,0.042606,0.071832,0.537515,0.00403,0.444279,Fear
I will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good.,0.168701,0.070026,0.120788,0.49627,0.036542,Joy

Why didnt i just turn the film off Mainly because I honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film.,0.146514,0.250456,0.0365,0.187791,0.343246,Sadness
But I was wrong in this case.,0.317133,0.418518,0.034421,0.007562,0.413871,Disgust

However I had three problems with this film.,0.348484,0.211237,0.157013,0.025722,0.41238,Sadness
One is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on but this may have just been my copy.,0.094412,0.043079,0.415432,0.014364,0.518467,Sadness

The third problem is that I didnt understand the ending but apparently some people do.,0.144177,0.396693,0.047244,0.000167,0.575455,Sadness
Of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things and the male lead is very 70s.,0.391376,0.36465,0.069152,0.001953,0.381524,Anger

That being said the character of Fay Grimm starts off in the film exactly where she was when Henry Fool ended but by the end of the film .,0.200473,0.57472,0.058598,0.037608,0.262282,Disgust

Consequently as a student of history theology mythology and film I found the dialogue outrageous and the plot themes to be somewhat insulting.,0.160026,0.704807,0.089817,0.025967,0.146251,Disgust

There is really no other reason given.,0.494092,0.104241,0.217822,0.028025,0.303141,Anger

Now in analyzing the true nature of the story leaving the obvious Christian vs. Also the name of the film is Aztec Rex leading one to believe that it is about dinosaurs out to eat people.,0.164455,0.451232,0.038837,0.075439,0.348509,Disgust

Hence why the title of the film was changed.,0.20506,0.115896,0.038385,0.122671,0.501997,Sadness
And so who in fact do we see as the new Aztec king at the end Its the remaining Spaniard Rios.,0.090189,0.110812,0.08197,0.329713,0.259768,Joy

As brilliant as Kings writing is the irony is that it simply doesnt translate well to the screen big or small.,0.111112,0.038464,0.148096,0.152732,0.480875,Sadness

Many people would disagree with this but Im sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed King story is but a pale memory of the one they read.,0.060823,0.128427,0.009994,0.20653,0.485044,Sadness
The reason is simple.,0.055388,0.018731,0.030899,0.604414,0.143901,Joy
The average King story takes place in the mindscape of the characters in the story.,0.137132,0.186403,0.067706,0.286524,0.236663,Joy

In short King takes the reader places where you cant put a Panavision camera.,0.10754,0.267236,0.212106,0.077372,0.392794,Sadness
As an audience watching the filmed King were left with less than half the information than the reader has access to.,0.196679,0.098521,0.156105,0.034394,0.594935,Sadness
Its not too far a stretch to claim that One becomes a character in a King story they read whereas One is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed.,0.270511,0.310441,0.108017,0.029801,0.423296,Sadness

There is one really good scene in Faat Kine.,0.108231,0.078111,0.014689,0.517168,0.146973,Joy
The title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened Faat Kine sprays her in the face.,0.251203,0.20245,0.111108,0.002114,0.59491,Sadness
The scene works because the act is so unexpected bizarre and rather funny at the same time.,0.217553,0.255176,0.155975,0.07738,0.373357,Sadness
In that one instance writerdirector Ousmane Sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours.,0.092545,0.085403,0.051152,0.465693,0.165392,Joy
In the scene he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions.,0.021498,0.535686,0.021364,0.304803,0.031435,Disgust
For the rest of the movie the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones.,0.14907,0.155575,0.230719,0.111834,0.368145,Sadness
The tone is all over the place.,0.129147,0.089525,0.137012,0.272307,0.269676,Joy
Its true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre but I dont think Faat Kine fits into any genre.,0.204044,0.086227,0.187052,0.188501,0.291004,Sadness
Supposedly its a drama though there are moments of such broad comedy the aforementioned spraying in the face that it cannot be taken seriously.,0.116743,0.116367,0.19269,0.013265,0.65853,Sadness
On the other hand the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics Sembene has crammed into the picture.,0.082046,0.240918,0.066186,0.474424,0.040154,Joy
There is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together.,0.14426,0.102447,0.099105,0.350186,0.189077,Joy
Unfortunately Semebene doesnt find that balance.,0.082306,0.017153,0.506401,0.001707,0.490188,Fear
Instead one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason leaving two different tones hanging in the wind.,0.104636,0.123091,0.268557,0.004028,0.621132,Sadness
Faat Kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale.,0.153236,0.084975,0.131644,0.023359,0.684137,Sadness
The film ends with a big party where all the characters conflicts are resolved only they arent resolved quickly.,0.16201,0.230117,0.18545,0.058775,0.444595,Sadness

I am not the right audience for it.,0.165235,0.175138,0.278541,0.034769,0.460016,Sadness
I felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story.,0.067357,0.100536,0.171227,0.10933,0.525251,Sadness

The small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed but when the film makers returned six years later the mood was depressed thanks to President Reagan.,0.194333,0.034804,0.011596,0.438185,0.183674,Joy
This seemed very disingenuous for several reasons.,0.14277,0.250362,0.131012,0.006617,0.612913,Sadness
First the 1979 portion was almost 90 of the film and the final 10 only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne.,0.165985,0.634628,0.172046,0.033919,0.140004,Disgust

While I am not a huge fan of Reagan because government growth did NOT slow during his administration the country in general was far more optimistic than it had been in the Ford and Carter years.,0.196572,0.590774,0.028634,0.009726,0.337928,Disgust
While many in the media demonized Reagan a popular sport in the 80s the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very onesided and agenda driven.,0.251194,0.25872,0.145941,0.019914,0.475466,Sadness

After watching a dozen episodes I decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling.,0.171122,0.164373,0.060843,0.200824,0.350315,Sadness
In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models I thought that my profession was being joked about.,0.17485,0.527431,0.04513,0.045997,0.325248,Disgust
I am not a mathematician instead a chemical engineer but I do work a lot with mathematical models.,0.126374,0.131062,0.098734,0.018342,0.709131,Sadness
So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to makebelieve of fairy tales.,0.377171,0.199371,0.170824,0.033619,0.367293,Anger
First choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task.,0.142244,0.042524,0.061178,0.272899,0.359821,Sadness
Individuals are erratic and haphazard there is no modeling for them.,0.194993,0.180432,0.214037,0.136816,0.287676,Sadness
Isaac Asimov even wrote about that in the 1950s.,0.129528,0.247474,0.162847,0.118244,0.3639,Sadness
Even if there were a model for specific kind of individual it would be a probabilistic stoichastic one meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction.,0.072613,0.230496,0.042964,0.058186,0.632247,Sadness
Second supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found the model parameters have to be known.,0.106107,0.270775,0.039444,0.053847,0.592994,Sadness
These parameters are the constants of the equations such as the gravity acceleration 9. 8 ms2 and often are not easy to determine.,0.216494,0.047645,0.152314,0.384457,0.095428,Joy
Again Charlie Eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses.,0.177294,0.263801,0.061729,0.179755,0.297222,Sadness
And after the model and the parameters are chosen they would have to be tested.,0.089797,0.066851,0.139291,0.169485,0.458502,Sadness
Oddly they are not and by miracle they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted.,0.088723,0.109383,0.071728,0.521446,0.092356,Joy
Third a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected not only by Numbers but also by scifi movies the computational effort required for solving these models.,0.17554,0.173191,0.212991,0.037832,0.498694,Sadness
Try to make Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a Herculean job.,0.161515,0.218957,0.05576,0.281235,0.213108,Joy
Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow.,0.18737,0.12666,0.188923,0.004302,0.62438,Sadness
And even with the right softwarehardware combination the model solution might well take days to be reached.,0.063975,0.033115,0.060395,0.565937,0.132723,Joy
He solves them immediately I could use his computer in my research work I would be very glad.,0.117981,0.097943,0.319796,0.170283,0.253268,Fear
As a drama it is far from being the best show.,0.050311,0.050658,0.051028,0.615844,0.100663,Joy
The characters are somewhat stereotyped but not even remotely funny as those in Big Bang Theory are.,0.078985,0.448696,0.152351,0.057599,0.346223,Disgust
The crimes are dull and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes make the FBI look pretty incompetent.,0.267774,0.141046,0.049542,0.130004,0.412694,Sadness
For some layman the show might work.,0.085952,0.07575,0.415119,0.208312,0.14809,Fear
For others the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow.,0.157533,0.131553,0.14566,0.228958,0.275961,Sadness

Nothing wrong with that in general.,0.154672,0.17994,0.176012,0.072036,0.473199,Sadness
What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich in the book of supposedly edgy Hollywood independent production.,0.332687,0.230019,0.104866,0.002161,0.51131,Sadness

Also there is a severe lack of midgets running about.,0.028867,0.098691,0.294251,0.07392,0.507633,Sadness
The only good bits are the cracking start and of course Reggie B. Possible SPOILER coming UpTo me this film seems like a filler between II and IV as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in IV.,0.104042,0.098014,0.06625,0.124776,0.561153,Sadness

Shes giving the film much needed name recognition it seems.,0.12213,0.273436,0.247162,0.059948,0.387333,Sadness

They should have skipped the whole Beane theme and developed a story that took place in N.

Since this is a longer movie it allows more time to develop the Clutter family and in this regard I think the 1996 movie has an advantage.,0.095844,0.144204,0.041244,0.252605,0.365079,Sadness

It still boggles my mind that after the Clutters were locked in the bathroom that Herb Clutter didnt force out the window so at least his children would have a chance to escape.,0.248301,0.316036,0.226363,0.005186,0.396708,Sadness

Still its distracting to viewers like me who have read tons about the case.,0.217881,0.345527,0.122118,0.043355,0.396322,Sadness
The actors playing the cops led by Sam Neill and Leo Rossi are uniformly excellent much better I think as a group than the actors in the original movie.,0.059823,0.109442,0.14684,0.348297,0.207357,Joy
They know that to secure the noose around the necks of both of them they have to get them to confess.,0.217082,0.088022,0.376523,0.024668,0.411342,Sadness
And the officers come to the interview impeccably prepared.,0.078491,0.556578,0.272418,0.113251,0.035982,Disgust
They had already discovered the likely alibi the phony story of going to Fort Scott and had debunked every jot of it.,0.205774,0.241256,0.179815,0.006727,0.525792,Sadness

Supposedly Hickcock later stated that the real reason for the crime wasnt to steal money from the Clutters but to rape Nancy Clutter.,0.439743,0.431675,0.04403,0.003241,0.29338,Anger

The story sensitively deals with Mrs. Clutters emotional problems most likely clinical depression and Mrs. Clutter displays remarkable inner strength when she firmly and strongly demands that the killers leave her daughter alone.,0.048729,0.006988,0.034184,0.002585,0.943816,Sadness
From what Ive read the Clutters surviving family was particularly bothered by how Bonnie Clutter was portrayed in the book claiming it was entirely untrue.,0.33942,0.206868,0.202941,0.022888,0.384044,Sadness
But as an aside both of the killers related to the police how Mr. Clutter asked them to not bother his wife because of her long illness.,0.341492,0.20326,0.187951,0.001273,0.455676,Sadness
Capote might make up that fiction to make the character of Bonnie more interesting but certainly the killers had no reason to falsely portray Mrs. Clutter and no doubt much of the conversation in the book duplicated in the movies is right off the taped confessions of the killers.,0.316014,0.073469,0.145609,0.073082,0.440217,Sadness
So it wouldve been nonsensical for Herb to have said that and not have it be true.,0.112929,0.208759,0.069402,0.181713,0.381277,Sadness

Director Steven Soderbergh and newbie commie sorry Steven but I had to take Soder shots here divides the movie in two partes on Commander Ernesto Che Guevaras revolutionary life.,0.144189,0.181817,0.212138,0.027069,0.542494,Sadness
Che Part 1 presents how Che in the mid 1950s joined Fidel Castros guerilla crew in their revolutionary quest to overthrow Cuban President Fulgencio Batistas regime.,0.092037,0.210394,0.135616,0.406402,0.058148,Joy

Che Part 2 presents Che trying to revolutionize the TShirt industry by pitching TShirts with his appalling bearbado face to TShirt manufacturers.,0.084375,0.473668,0.178308,0.141744,0.15032,Disgust

That is where I think Soderbergh executed a cinematic injustice by not showing the viewers how atrocious Guevara really was.,0.444321,0.234908,0.123751,0.0076,0.380307,Anger
I did decide to see Che in hopes that Soderbergh would not glamorize him but instead present how disturbed he really was.,0.167821,0.308967,0.106403,0.135271,0.303909,Disgust
Unfortunately Soderbergh did not do the latter and sadly decided to present Guevara as a Revolutionary hero which he was not.,0.061315,0.083959,0.068093,0.030483,0.791552,Sadness

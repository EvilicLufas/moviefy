It is a fine mixture of live action and animation.,0.065804,0.123939,0.170293,0.353345,0.166739,Joy
It is set in a past period of British history if not the Edwardian  Georgian world of 1912 London it is Englands coastline during the Dunkirk Summer of 1940.,0.020408,0.037576,0.0866,0.42346,0.259542,Joy

Ironically it was Owens final role.,0.100674,0.154204,0.31124,0.142584,0.2795,Fear
The Home Guard sequences not too many in the film reminds one of the British series DADS ARMY dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war.,0.11177,0.032364,0.283542,0.02097,0.623208,Sadness

All of which surprisingly is a plus.,0.149963,0.084061,0.3098,0.220877,0.172063,Fear

Viggo Mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman although perhaps not to the same extent.,0.084188,0.110859,0.089519,0.328446,0.260167,Joy
In a manner of speaking he is the villain of the piece but he successfully gives the character a third dimension.,0.382175,0.516087,0.119414,0.041882,0.10611,Disgust
Yes his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded but not many men would act any differently in his situation.,0.253981,0.352178,0.260717,0.036294,0.262401,Disgust

Mason Darings original music while not standing out in any way gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not.,0.192161,0.107376,0.07988,0.36805,0.14938,Joy
Roger Ebert is right when he points out that while Liev is a great actor putting him alongside Viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake.,0.108023,0.273958,0.10267,0.136771,0.377681,Sadness

Youre probably very confused right now.,0.045958,0.039587,0.44161,0.056289,0.438925,Fear
The idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the subgame within the web site called The Dead Code where they pilot a plane over a city spraying it with bioweapons.,0.33684,0.119832,0.179191,0.003337,0.524457,Sadness
In the movie this actually happens.,0.117302,0.165692,0.140882,0.208897,0.307091,Sadness

The one novel thing I noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a Matt Damon movie and then later there is the phrase Good Hunting Will.,0.131612,0.050818,0.140843,0.369541,0.179301,Joy

Police investigations murder suspicion we are all so acquainted with them in movies galore.,0.325311,0.551992,0.243187,0.009607,0.095464,Disgust
Most of the films nowadays deal with crime which is believed to involve viewers to provide them with a thrilling atmosphere.,0.234693,0.196784,0.027486,0.177644,0.340179,Sadness
However most of thrill lovers will rather concentrate on latest movies of that sort forgetting about older ones.,0.112857,0.133567,0.224764,0.152871,0.350678,Sadness
Yet it occurs that these people may easily be misled.,0.328595,0.266518,0.169205,0.008342,0.415375,Sadness
A film entirely based on suspicion may be very interesting now despite being more than 20 years old. it is GARDE A VUE a unique movie by Claude Miller.,0.131809,0.141847,0.154147,0.339233,0.135176,Joy
Is there much of the action Not really since the events presented in the movie take place in a considerably short time.,0.141992,0.091536,0.224332,0.113914,0.425811,Sadness
But the way they are executed is the movies great plus.,0.045577,0.025508,0.110267,0.663252,0.038737,Joy
Jerome Charles Martinaud Michel Serrault is being investigated by Inspector Gallien Lino Ventura and Insector Belmont Guy Marchand.,0.122316,0.322827,0.115943,0.252205,0.144321,Disgust
Its a New Years Eve a rainy evening and not very accurate for such a meeting.,0.103689,0.017405,0.018735,0.481417,0.21837,Joy
Yet after the rape and murder of two children at the dawn of the old year the door of suspicion must be open at last.,0.188892,0.751613,0.062771,0.002426,0.159023,Disgust
In other words more quoted from the movie it must be revealed who an evil wolf really is.,0.254924,0.301248,0.194655,0.1263,0.181415,Disgust
To achieve this one needs lots of effort and also lots of emotions from both parties.,0.045659,0.055997,0.125387,0.592703,0.054907,Joy
Some people criticize the script for being too wordy.,0.390696,0.476854,0.205111,0.007359,0.149769,Disgust
Yet I would ask them what should an investigation be like if not many questions and practically much talk.,0.189128,0.115301,0.196982,0.031382,0.565998,Sadness
This wordiness touches the very roots of the genre.,0.190712,0.203928,0.227434,0.2102,0.145552,Fear
In no way is this boring but throughout the entire film it makes you as a viewer as an observer involved.,0.243498,0.296089,0.211503,0.020172,0.395257,Sadness
Moreover the film contains well made flashbacks as the stories are being told.,0.128142,0.140507,0.075281,0.349238,0.197917,Joy
Not too much and not too little of them  just enough to make the whole story clearer and more interesting.,0.160701,0.063277,0.050425,0.494339,0.108298,Joy
The most memorable flashbacks for me are when Chantal Romy Schneider Martinauds wife talks about one lovely Christmas.,0.033918,0.028001,0.019473,0.773631,0.054228,Joy
But these flashbacks also contain the views of the places including the infamous beach.,0.111761,0.289812,0.102691,0.295279,0.131036,Joy
It all wonderfully helped me keep the right pace.,0.080123,0.015827,0.073305,0.588605,0.105081,Joy
And since I saw GARDE A VUE I always mention this film as one of the defenders of French cinema against accusations of mess and chaos.,0.558,0.308159,0.126168,0.016293,0.182627,Anger
But those already mentioned aspects may not necessarily appeal to many viewers since they might not like such movies and still wont find the content and its execution satisfactory.,0.156814,0.107677,0.404776,0.000448,0.477023,Sadness
Yet GARDE A VUE is worth seeing also for such people.,0.074171,0.233505,0.021223,0.400928,0.15942,Joy
Why For the sake of performances.,0.050732,0.524072,0.058561,0.214441,0.111036,Disgust
But here dont expect me to praise foremost Romy Schneider.,0.106108,0.19901,0.027738,0.318739,0.245505,Joy
GARDE A VUE is not Romy Schneider vehicle.,0.168726,0.135001,0.224773,0.138736,0.334805,Sadness
She does a terrific job as a mother who is deeply in despair for a lost child.,0.248086,0.368461,0.093036,0.041362,0.37925,Sadness
She credibly portrays a person who is calm concrete who does not refuse an offered cup of tea but who does not want to play with words.,0.084557,0.343914,0.030037,0.103092,0.452877,Sadness
Her part which includes a profound talk of life and duty is brilliant more credible than the overly melancholic role of Elsa in LA PASSANTE DE SANS SOUCI.,0.102064,0.178906,0.04348,0.329187,0.23405,Joy
It is still acted.,0.346558,0.179152,0.136782,0.026929,0.45281,Sadness
However Romy Schneider does not have much time on screen.,0.135552,0.107388,0.127385,0.033815,0.661208,Sadness
Practically she appears for the first time after 45 minutes from the credits.,0.038409,0.075641,0.377076,0.050357,0.49281,Sadness
she as a wife and a different viewpoint comes symbolically with the New Year at midnight.,0.187167,0.01635,0.044724,0.605968,0.037791,Joy
Her role is a purely supporting one.,0.124774,0.180867,0.130354,0.236779,0.26462,Sadness
Who really rocks is Lino Ventura.,0.148666,0.027984,0.088698,0.510168,0.095628,Joy
He IS the middle aged Inspector Antoine Gallien who wants to find out the truth who is aware that his questions are missiles towards the other interlocutor but does not hesitate.,0.30463,0.085761,0.2159,0.085284,0.363773,Sadness
He is an inspector who having been married three times is perfectly acknowledged of womens psyche.,0.126062,0.216453,0.03312,0.422348,0.103119,Joy
He is the one who does not regard his job as a game to play but a real service.,0.164999,0.146137,0.076416,0.186145,0.378877,Sadness
Finally he is a person who does not find it abnormal to sit there on New Years Eve.,0.184031,0.210864,0.04464,0.238509,0.262508,Sadness
Michel Serrault also does a fine job expressing fear particularly in the final scenes of the movie.,0.045368,0.124973,0.854531,0.008013,0.049794,Fear
But thumbs up for Mr Ventura.,0.190036,0.127519,0.160461,0.189273,0.292883,Sadness
BrilliantAs far as memorable moments are concerned this is not the sort of film in which this aspect is easily analyzed.,0.154676,0.100988,0.278876,0.203338,0.220844,Fear
The entire film is memorable has to be seen more than once and has to be felt with its atmosphere and which I have not mentioned before gorgeous music.,0.03727,0.047329,0.063692,0.628705,0.093195,Joy
For me the talk of Chantal and Inspector Gallien is the most brilliant flawless moment.,0.063844,0.042727,0.074833,0.441157,0.218184,Joy
You are there with the two characters you experience their states of mind if you go deeper into what you see.,0.092444,0.110472,0.09165,0.3327,0.248518,Joy
GARDE A VUE is a very interesting film a must see for thrill lovers and connoisseurs of artistic performances.,0.039229,0.059359,0.034814,0.675286,0.075556,Joy

I am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007s films.,0.123387,0.119419,0.19724,0.342123,0.118581,Joy
Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead is a deviously stylish morality tale and quite a dark bleak and depressing one at that.,0.077482,0.087177,0.232403,0.001519,0.703837,Sadness
Its one of those films whose plots are so thick that one is very reluctant to go into details.,0.098312,0.338653,0.390053,0.059941,0.211491,Fear
It is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold as there are twists and turns.,0.049214,0.048533,0.056774,0.559718,0.139929,Joy
But the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film.,0.256379,0.11499,0.205848,0.10744,0.343952,Sadness
the true focus is as I mentioned the morality tale.,0.061753,0.043453,0.089776,0.573916,0.095863,Joy
the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film.,0.174879,0.39463,0.124319,0.225681,0.069559,Disgust
Sizzling sharp thick and precariously depressing Kelly Mastersons screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded in particular because it is a debut screenplay.,0.115135,0.050423,0.108317,0.055065,0.679811,Sadness
But the film has much more going for it than just its delectably sinister and quite depressing plot.,0.147874,0.232407,0.25734,0.00662,0.500878,Sadness
First and foremost the picture looks and feels outstandingly well.,0.026192,0.058062,0.150093,0.441787,0.169592,Joy
Sidney Lumet has throughout his career consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time.,0.102431,0.025933,0.075055,0.484586,0.164061,Joy
The film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great.,0.038646,0.033762,0.04949,0.792077,0.011454,Joy
Editing is topnotch.,0.1701,0.12845,0.168622,0.179842,0.314286,Sadness
combining the sizzling dramathriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly.,0.10302,0.065397,0.125992,0.434915,0.139746,Joy
And vivid dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style.,0.08605,0.052018,0.096599,0.531751,0.100678,Joy
The film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by Carter Burwell.,0.023931,0.125671,0.158095,0.427558,0.129403,Joy
The screenplay does its part and of course Lumet does his part but at the films dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances.,0.055194,0.033045,0.013189,0.498531,0.23126,Joy
First and foremost there are the two leads.,0.104475,0.171898,0.124212,0.209466,0.330788,Sadness
His turn in this film is fascinating severely flawed broken manic.,0.140349,0.189621,0.248143,0.021076,0.524208,Sadness
Hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out and not just his subtlety and wit.,0.278918,0.332106,0.015347,0.256658,0.088081,Disgust
At his side is Ethan Hawke who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater grander actors.,0.019977,0.028476,0.035179,0.65455,0.122974,Joy
Here he bounces off Hoffman and complements him so incredibly well. in all the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that its watching actors.,0.072097,0.085008,0.093709,0.257071,0.374366,Sadness

Director Michael Powell once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well.,0.097329,0.028254,0.046699,0.447401,0.22462,Joy
Powell and Pressburger created a seemingly simple superbly crafted story  the power of love against the powers that be.,0.022024,0.032175,0.011361,0.792239,0.055274,Joy

Or is it The question is never answered one way or the other.,0.360128,0.082509,0.120836,0.014561,0.554503,Sadness
Actually it is never even asked.,0.29322,0.54287,0.055733,0.002025,0.309716,Disgust
This continuous understatement is part of the films appeal.,0.086181,0.244709,0.09779,0.250985,0.248142,Joy
The innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers.,0.028619,0.040898,0.076711,0.632028,0.089729,Joy
For instance Pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of Richard Strauss opera Der Rosenkavalier about a young 18th century Viennese aristocrat.,0.137764,0.076078,0.170331,0.083284,0.537131,Sadness
This is evident in the brief interlude in which Conductor 71 dressed in all his finery holds the rose which appears silver in heaven.,0.132107,0.133926,0.311214,0.156558,0.249018,Fear
The music even has a dreamy quality.,0.127168,0.052733,0.019707,0.56582,0.107489,Joy
All of the acting is first rate  David Niven is at his most charming and he has excellent support from veteran Roger Livesey and relative newcomer Kim Hunter.,0.047627,0.281127,0.089688,0.440784,0.044387,Joy
But in my opinion the films charm comes from Marius Goring as Conductor 71.,0.11841,0.176622,0.07797,0.453405,0.070318,Joy
He by far has the most interesting role filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness brightening the film.,0.1264,0.267125,0.02118,0.331975,0.165784,Joy
Its a pity that some of Conductor 71s scenes were left on the cutting room floor.,0.339882,0.315911,0.139743,0.002068,0.406315,Sadness
It is also a pity that Gorings comedic talents are rarely seen again on film except in the wonderful videos of The Scarlet Pimpernel television series from the 1950s.,0.079579,0.082399,0.113387,0.456362,0.136059,Joy
This is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career.,0.100915,0.271255,0.234215,0.100625,0.338846,Sadness
He is a perfect foil for relaxed style of Niven and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters.,0.112187,0.024444,0.039311,0.639386,0.068305,Joy
Ironically also in the mid 1940s Niven also starred against another heavenly messenger played by Cary Grant in The Bishops Wife.,0.056639,0.16385,0.078704,0.482817,0.098019,Joy
Their acting styles were so similar that I found the result boring unenergetic and disappointing.,0.080147,0.248791,0.097685,0.065728,0.550306,Sadness
As a note according to Powell Goring desperately wanted the role of Peter Carter initially refusing Conductor 71.,0.413943,0.423922,0.069273,0.006725,0.293013,Disgust
Its a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal.,0.057901,0.037107,0.071002,0.617681,0.086542,Joy
The movie commissioned to smooth over the strained relations between Britain and the U.  overdrives its point towards the end.,0.312279,0.131151,0.170983,0.128787,0.279081,Anger

Powell and Pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasnt necessary.,0.351296,0.183852,0.219343,0.039079,0.34659,Anger
The movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the Atlantic.,0.037447,0.168984,0.058257,0.508867,0.101895,Joy

Some of the tasks are monumentally difficult with only a day or two to complete.,0.250572,0.13493,0.110928,0.132943,0.377142,Sadness
Tasks may involve creating a TV commercial or print ad.,0.3222,0.34012,0.056126,0.195044,0.106176,Disgust
Others may involve selling at a retail outlet or on the street.,0.2429,0.300738,0.302372,0.049797,0.244078,Fear
The tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants.,0.105257,0.138192,0.191414,0.263306,0.22346,Joy

Project managers even those on the winning teams often do not formulate a cohesive strategy.,0.117937,0.190623,0.013007,0.4241,0.142286,Joy
They often believe that by diving off the deep end to complete the task at the first minute rather than taking a little time to organize and discuss how the task will be completed is more efficient.,0.202961,0.095966,0.069824,0.279509,0.263543,Joy

My leastfavorite aspect of The Apprentice is the board room.,0.249915,0.271389,0.184954,0.1302,0.214383,Disgust

Jake Speed is a film that lacks one thing  a charismatic lead.,0.252583,0.232956,0.130842,0.011271,0.528145,Sadness
Although its genesis probably can be traced back to the success of the Indiana Jones trilogy  the film actually plays a little more like Romancing the Stone albeit in reverse.,0.048816,0.098752,0.070686,0.517542,0.127949,Joy

This is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and renaming.,0.267009,0.359016,0.224239,0.00579,0.347109,Disgust
It doesnt work at all.,0.092238,0.029073,0.343675,0.004714,0.624431,Sadness
Firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong.,0.296449,0.216018,0.065601,0.002153,0.586832,Sadness
Its very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end.,0.142308,0.051589,0.365674,0.018327,0.519588,Sadness
But there is also and that may have to do with the cuts an uneasy moving between genres.,0.212143,0.317998,0.376104,0.041081,0.201462,Fear
It starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire.,0.134907,0.253609,0.181652,0.015994,0.543433,Sadness
the ending may be funny but its also so blunt that I almost felt it insulted my intelligence what little there is.,0.227159,0.230873,0.354677,0.027335,0.315183,Fear

You can also see that in the very unsteady character development.,0.083966,0.208292,0.115169,0.268125,0.241021,Joy

A CRY IN THE DARK A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid if unremarkable film.,0.022973,0.064404,0.153289,0.003623,0.814842,Sadness

The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlains continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court which suspects Lindy of murder.,0.260698,0.567316,0.174326,0.076371,0.051465,Disgust
The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping.,0.264414,0.231563,0.075942,0.183211,0.240323,Anger
As an audience member I was fully invested in the Chamberlains plight.,0.092707,0.147165,0.045389,0.025258,0.746487,Sadness

For me this ranks as one of if not 1 Meryl Streeps best performances.,0.026656,0.052056,0.023605,0.70583,0.079004,Joy
For all her mastery of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters.,0.126835,0.016966,0.067823,0.281143,0.369589,Sadness

Solid acting particularly by George Beban father of silent child actor George Beban Jr.  and wonderful sets convey a realistic feeling of early immigrant tenements in New York.,0.214285,0.055217,0.056221,0.418874,0.140627,Joy

This is by far the films biggest flaw.,0.109846,0.322072,0.222247,0.073238,0.343958,Sadness
Victor Vargas isnt so much a character but a pingpong ball bouncing between scenes with Judy and his Grandmother but we never get to know who Victor Vargas really is.,0.122166,0.172054,0.053802,0.198861,0.399781,Sadness

Something that few films have done before in the past.,0.075374,0.15092,0.177043,0.257865,0.249949,Joy

If Victor Vargas were truly a great film and story then the characters applicability wouldnt matter whether they were Latino Chinese etc. Indeed some other aspects of the use of Latinos in this film bother me.,0.089333,0.106407,0.047947,0.537356,0.0956,Joy
While some aspects of Victor Vargas are accurate others I have to question.,0.102471,0.074612,0.050892,0.440955,0.193028,Joy

This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fastmoving story an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths etc. Funny thing is you probably couldnt make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police.,0.38417,0.446342,0.065209,0.008437,0.301608,Disgust

Still I recommend it.,0.223062,0.08996,0.062489,0.264198,0.272131,Sadness

Whats the question then perhaps you should thank God if youve never met a Lacanian.,0.011473,0.070927,0.022584,0.565671,0.173498,Joy
Slavoj Zizek the most evangelical of Lacanians would surely exchange the word Jesus in that statement for LacanHegel.,0.240506,0.273164,0.158527,0.162941,0.195417,Disgust
Zizeks star burns brightly at the moment no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption.,0.240784,0.230237,0.185554,0.160581,0.196942,Anger
So it seems impressive when someone  anyone  comes along and says Hang on films may say something about ourselves.,0.103842,0.314658,0.220357,0.07076,0.368854,Sadness
The ideas Zizek expounds in this film are true purely because he says so.,0.203342,0.330805,0.038621,0.220786,0.181208,Disgust
For example Zizek explains that three Marx Bros are the ego superego and id God knows what happened to Zeppo or Gummo  perhaps theyre the sinthome.,0.451091,0.146268,0.094956,0.024973,0.424708,Anger
or is that movies themselves.,0.084175,0.075132,0.104905,0.394188,0.201281,Joy
This is simply what they are.,0.168009,0.156741,0.149108,0.172922,0.32351,Sadness
In Zizeks output culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology.,0.379647,0.234136,0.135695,0.074222,0.287445,Anger
As Zizek seems to believe they may even serve as a proof.,0.20889,0.423508,0.048513,0.024534,0.439331,Sadness
However it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context.,0.316773,0.224304,0.14589,0.026696,0.432537,Sadness
Without context you can say and prove anything you want.,0.242968,0.254171,0.086854,0.032558,0.507124,Sadness
For Zizek Lacan is the answer  so he goes and makes an example of it.,0.362888,0.239499,0.166804,0.077121,0.26099,Anger
Everything but everything resembles the teachings of the Master and culture is there to bear this out to serve this ideology.,0.219275,0.230536,0.108483,0.28694,0.104357,Joy
For instance Zizeks exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in Vertigo when Jimmy Stewart spies on Kim Novak in a flower shop.,0.203697,0.471281,0.129852,0.071336,0.227194,Disgust
But in the context of the film this is not a voyeurs fantasy position at all.,0.162422,0.24737,0.142881,0.233375,0.173455,Disgust
Stewart has been deliberately led there by Novak.,0.278513,0.297782,0.046396,0.04496,0.4548,Sadness
This presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout Zizeks two hour and a half cinematic sermon.,0.297274,0.328086,0.073633,0.023238,0.435482,Sadness
His analysis of the baby wants to f scene in Blue Velvet is laughable.,0.170572,0.413179,0.062152,0.041015,0.427021,Sadness
This is an example of her jouissance.,0.452257,0.33042,0.108788,0.029843,0.255402,Anger
But  sorry to be prosaic  where is the evidence for this In the film she partially undergoes her humiliations because Hopper has kidnapped her son.,0.112664,0.128796,0.331365,0.004917,0.550413,Sadness
Zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with Kyle MacLachalan.,0.030463,0.296099,0.087912,0.418009,0.064811,Joy
But this may be due to any number of things.,0.132067,0.034833,0.482838,0.033909,0.392169,Fear
If this is right then no example can be made of it.,0.136117,0.043053,0.043736,0.56564,0.087521,Joy
It also means that the entire concept is nonsensical and entirely mystical.,0.12517,0.199167,0.14435,0.15712,0.355335,Sadness
It can only be designated by dogmatists such as Zizek Theres feminine jouissance for you Why is this feminine jouissance Because I say so.,0.166633,0.213476,0.097367,0.110339,0.433812,Sadness
What example can really be garnered from these films Only Zizeks psychology.,0.553692,0.141947,0.153556,0.045895,0.231587,Anger
Zizeks theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws.,0.034034,0.211168,0.111246,0.444497,0.083659,Joy
This film illustrates how Zizek desires and only extremely vaguely  as to be almost useless  how the rest of us desire.,0.3226,0.13005,0.137316,0.282451,0.080354,Anger
For as any psychoanalyst knows how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated  and cannot be easily universalised if at all.,0.076744,0.105036,0.091875,0.373585,0.225011,Joy
Zizeks love of making everything an example of Lacans Answer bears this out how do we desire like this this is how I do it.,0.088571,0.085788,0.019157,0.661388,0.044594,Joy
Problem is in Zizeks desire everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire.,0.103228,0.030635,0.099393,0.368083,0.253085,Joy
But Zizek is a Leninist and they certainly dont like letting the subject speak for itself.,0.288941,0.255517,0.23855,0.026416,0.356022,Sadness
The Perverts Guide to the Cinema is a summation Zizeks love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political what dogma isnt.,0.133131,0.172826,0.004399,0.17713,0.450945,Sadness
Zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing.,0.126799,0.215337,0.058345,0.331213,0.178199,Joy
Hes a kind of Henry Ford of cultural theory massproduction and any colour as long as its black.,0.087946,0.223378,0.170895,0.244575,0.209486,Joy

This is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems  which capitalism always claims to provide  rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all.,0.331465,0.224515,0.099259,0.002961,0.518726,Sadness
Which is kind of like being brain dead.,0.141679,0.274527,0.183018,0.018122,0.522476,Sadness
For me Zizeks third Matrix pill is a suicide capsule.,0.103966,0.099191,0.302112,0.007845,0.597225,Sadness
PS I loved Zizeks solemn remark  presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity  that music in films can greatly affect peoples sympathies.,0.088369,0.113487,0.005046,0.649069,0.045253,Joy

Up until its arrival on the scene there had never really been anything like The League of Gentlemen before.,0.197742,0.376741,0.047599,0.013038,0.520023,Sadness

What really sets the show apart from its rivals is its approach to telling us its story.,0.15612,0.114245,0.210298,0.114424,0.411428,Sadness
Rather than serve us rehashed sketches barely distinguishable from the next here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys and story lines.,0.308927,0.277413,0.116674,0.081863,0.306088,Anger

The narrative driven and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series and this bold move by the League really pays off.,0.113982,0.152516,0.230697,0.180586,0.286519,Sadness
The third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style as well as a real treat for fans whove already seen the first two.,0.077245,0.115071,0.031532,0.465527,0.171801,Joy
It might take a little trying to get into the change in style but its definitely worth it and in my opinion the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series.,0.085278,0.019224,0.075838,0.632488,0.06581,Joy

Cains publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic.,0.094034,0.069786,0.115215,0.293397,0.301902,Sadness

This of course not in the least is due to the movie its great strong story that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism.,0.02708,0.024093,0.074979,0.483095,0.218165,Joy
It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment.,0.115255,0.061323,0.108934,0.354441,0.228073,Joy

Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts.,0.051305,0.083639,0.343413,0.003181,0.617324,Sadness
The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.,0.067793,0.03823,0.176595,0.10002,0.579767,Sadness

Problem with these type of movies is that literally dozens of them are being made each year.,0.185204,0.218107,0.084525,0.063555,0.513833,Sadness
Luckily for use only a handful are given a theatrical release while the others are being pushed straight to video or TV such as this movie.,0.144199,0.191622,0.034568,0.177268,0.405839,Sadness
The foremost problem of this movie is really its originality.,0.252247,0.065366,0.129316,0.070396,0.530186,Sadness
Its one of those movies which uses the Die Hard formula of a tough but troubled guy being at the wrong place at the wrong time.,0.135704,0.179965,0.112666,0.000346,0.703035,Sadness

You can see this movie as a sort of mix of Die Hard and Air Force One and the movie doesnt even try to conceal that those two movies were probably its biggest source of inspiration.,0.085846,0.218516,0.202207,0.005293,0.616172,Sadness
So really you cant regard this movie as an original one at all.,0.143903,0.080991,0.132465,0.256894,0.288754,Sadness
It uses all of the clichs out of the book and this movie really doesnt offer any surprises or anything that remotely resembles anything original.,0.142793,0.175833,0.050586,0.19662,0.377787,Sadness
Like you can expect from a movie such as this it has a very weak script.,0.440711,0.411445,0.104816,0.036061,0.18554,Anger
Or rather said it features some very lazy writing.,0.096435,0.229845,0.060076,0.005117,0.724112,Sadness
Like I said before the movie features nothing original but also the actual story itself features some elements which are far from likely and are just plain ridicules truthfully.,0.20072,0.368592,0.062691,0.011801,0.511729,Sadness
How do they even intend to split that money afterward Every person gets just over a million or something Thats hardly profitable for such a big and risky undertaking.,0.08027,0.491415,0.230464,0.011075,0.345669,Disgust
And then there is the case of taking the passengers hostage.,0.271261,0.283109,0.193081,0.04509,0.347354,Sadness
You never see more than like 30 hostages however as if they were all the people who were aboard at the time.,0.225816,0.298518,0.159112,0.022669,0.446324,Sadness
Also when the Van Dien character goes looking for his son and vice versa no matter which room they walk in through on the huge cruise ship they always bump into each other instantly.,0.080953,0.134592,0.051528,0.223081,0.409923,Sadness
Just some examples of the lazy writing within the movie.,0.140939,0.404998,0.139642,0.044451,0.386397,Disgust
But it of course is an action flick so the story of course becomes secondary.,0.222177,0.115455,0.102208,0.296916,0.184335,Joy
But then again its not as if this movie features any good action at all.,0.057082,0.030496,0.048094,0.593422,0.128145,Joy
Halve of the actors look as if they had never hold a weapon before and the movie is filled with some ridicules slowmotion.,0.212652,0.262568,0.114004,0.067404,0.425299,Sadness
It really becomes laughable at points.,0.352399,0.189568,0.086059,0.029782,0.474761,Sadness
Of course the movie also doesnt feature the best actors though I must say that Casper Van Dien really isnt a bad action hero and actor as far as the genre and Bmovie circuit is concerned.,0.103162,0.188339,0.089648,0.265599,0.265778,Sadness
He just however also suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise.,0.075032,0.065874,0.155481,0.005905,0.777202,Sadness

Van Dien once started out as a promising new young actor but starring in movies like this really doesnt help his career much.,0.077348,0.075127,0.04058,0.23966,0.446905,Sadness
Hes probably capable of something better though he is never really given the right opportunity to show it.,0.115022,0.021764,0.088542,0.316991,0.316603,Joy

Kornbluth plays Kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp.,0.072903,0.084464,0.144932,0.343708,0.2278,Joy

The thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of Kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position.,0.031805,0.024133,0.851353,0.005596,0.136375,Fear
These are important letters however and by the end of the week Kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk.,0.118093,0.059144,0.145964,0.1666,0.444204,Sadness

And thats exactly what Kornbluth does here.,0.107862,0.521954,0.042052,0.167909,0.158401,Disgust
so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the Kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie.,0.097382,0.251176,0.151295,0.002674,0.634171,Sadness
In trying to discern exactly why this movie doesnt work it comes down to two basic reasons The directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless.,0.266518,0.160129,0.200479,0.00121,0.53944,Sadness
and secondly the performances beginning with that of Josh Kornbluth.,0.06216,0.062868,0.169505,0.428832,0.137926,Joy
Quite simply Kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here.,0.139495,0.134064,0.143684,0.112505,0.464502,Sadness
Unlike Stiller or even Steve Martin both of whom use selfdeprecating humor very effectively Kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light.,0.139286,0.490225,0.125331,0.03523,0.346281,Disgust
he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real Kornbluth is in reality much more clever than Kornbluth the character.,0.144557,0.139177,0.216812,0.039289,0.547363,Sadness

The one saving grace of the film is the performance by Warren Keith as Shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous.,0.041565,0.080157,0.03782,0.560222,0.138608,Joy
The effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project.,0.159631,0.251594,0.062067,0.152866,0.361073,Sadness
Shumaker and Sarah Overman Julie Faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable.,0.049139,0.178926,0.121668,0.45415,0.084621,Joy

The film focuses exclusively on three middleclass teenage girls in a tidy new Paris suburb.,0.082479,0.155394,0.079348,0.516433,0.055513,Joy
Their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team.,0.045534,0.228674,0.035428,0.407894,0.16179,Joy

The central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny Marie Pauline Acquart who is not on the team but thinks she would like to be.,0.373684,0.177877,0.108969,0.03752,0.427165,Sadness

This takes Marie away from her former best friend also a member of the water ballet team the somewhat plump Anne Louise Blachre.,0.109361,0.416189,0.068235,0.121049,0.312994,Disgust
Being less special Anne is more truly accessible to the boys.,0.050719,0.046925,0.077686,0.494984,0.174085,Joy
Floriane like this film promises a bit more then she truly offers.,0.039995,0.219072,0.021763,0.436668,0.154426,Joy
Marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl she suffers inwardly.,0.174534,0.154997,0.210378,0.074895,0.437227,Sadness
Flroiane doesnt so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt.,0.103743,0.08773,0.365229,0.00673,0.551938,Sadness

Floriane takes advantage of this to make Marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations then lacking any other friends her confidante.,0.097294,0.213093,0.209027,0.175098,0.276287,Sadness

Anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid thats earthier and more real than the other girls.,0.080301,0.227311,0.295745,0.171135,0.205068,Fear
Keeping all external context at bay Sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls goals and interactions.,0.102018,0.197402,0.125599,0.303852,0.179998,Joy
Luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their everpresent goals and avoidances and just do silly pointless girl things.,0.16692,0.285722,0.249717,0.045853,0.364286,Sadness

too bad in a way that there arent more of them.,0.284137,0.186638,0.280049,0.007766,0.419141,Sadness
But Sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics.,0.103483,0.068059,0.194753,0.324382,0.191875,Joy
Along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls who understandably love to gaze at themselves.,0.059147,0.07604,0.080848,0.607895,0.057341,Joy

The script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where I expect it was intended to be edgy.,0.322108,0.170378,0.255561,0.061732,0.298117,Anger
The characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichs that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front.,0.12661,0.630984,0.074581,0.137307,0.05748,Disgust
The biggest problem is this movie has no real story.,0.059932,0.11466,0.124668,0.016883,0.749458,Sadness
It ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was.,0.218812,0.033807,0.272433,0.020753,0.555178,Sadness

First off I would like to point out that while I am not an expert the way the trial was handled will insult your intelligence.,0.494872,0.224285,0.042069,0.016572,0.386136,Anger
Firstly the prosecution never proved that facilitated learning actually works.,0.296473,0.203049,0.179245,0.162938,0.176898,Anger

Thirdly this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecutionbirthmarks details of the event etc.  and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started he could not answer.,0.215011,0.360326,0.15704,0.013884,0.425495,Sadness

The first time I saw this film on TV it was about 1981 and I remember taping it off of my mothers betamax.,0.054187,0.407079,0.046651,0.128295,0.360382,Disgust
It wound up taping in black and white for some reason which gave it a period look that I grew to like.,0.059772,0.219977,0.232063,0.167463,0.292323,Sadness
I remember very distinctively the film beginning with the song My Bonnie as the camera panned over a scene of Liverpool.,0.046056,0.161001,0.142707,0.328636,0.2039,Joy
When you see how slowly the camera pans vs. the speed of the music you can see that She Loves You just doesnt fit.,0.055368,0.073686,0.041331,0.485805,0.190493,Joy

Why they felt they had to Americanize this film for American audiences is beyond me.,0.13984,0.629781,0.132846,0.039831,0.185919,Disgust
Personally if Im going to watch a film about a British band I want all of the British colloquialisms and such that would be a part of their speech mannerisms etc.,0.126266,0.246405,0.107776,0.212648,0.263899,Sadness
Another irritation was how choppy the editing was for television.,0.2832,0.262968,0.123031,0.025732,0.449269,Sadness

My point is the best version of this film was probably the earlier version I taped from 1981 which just so happened to include the Shake Rattle  Roll scene that my 1998 version didnt.,0.037011,0.147711,0.158916,0.074214,0.589039,Sadness
I started to surmise that there had to have been two different versions made for television and a look at the alternate versions link regarding this film proved me right.,0.056776,0.090651,0.183809,0.218304,0.354826,Sadness
That the American version had some shortercutdifferent scenes andor dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if one cares about such things.,0.046286,0.213783,0.056349,0.004999,0.770683,Sadness
Imo ones best bet is to try and get a hold of the European version of this film if possible and probably even less possible an unedited version.,0.106557,0.404838,0.27722,0.118766,0.144832,Disgust
Sadly I had to discard my old betamax European version because I didnt know how to convert it.,0.059498,0.135745,0.217267,0.001072,0.695566,Sadness

These are all depicted quite accurately and just to add a little extra the movie manages to convey the power of meditation and Ki energy in a way that makes it integral to the story i. it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does it in such a way as to make it tactical and menacing.,0.078017,0.055053,0.039865,0.569483,0.121222,Joy

This 1996 movie was the first adaptation of Jane Eyre that I ever watched and when I did so I was appalled by it.,0.383458,0.138992,0.091479,0.227006,0.130086,Anger
So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester.,0.099268,0.040873,0.279315,0.004524,0.667441,Sadness
This is without doubt the most exquisite Jane Eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned.,0.314976,0.091055,0.366632,0.0134,0.367797,Sadness
In addition his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes.,0.342788,0.315731,0.226963,0.018146,0.28693,Anger
As a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between Jane and Rochester and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse.,0.092859,0.233948,0.067561,0.016067,0.693281,Sadness
We know that they are supposed to fall in love but we never see it actually happen.,0.067462,0.229263,0.188643,0.042219,0.545996,Sadness
What remains is just a glimpse of the novel which does no justice to Charlotte Bronts masterpiece.,0.108612,0.098553,0.092394,0.388803,0.186982,Joy
The cast is a mixed bag While Fiona Shaw is an excellent Mrs Reed Anna Paquins young Jane is more an illmannered pout Lolita than a lonely little girl longing for love.,0.009766,0.257088,0.034073,0.317761,0.258869,Joy
Charlotte Gainsbourgh as the grownup heroine however is physically a perfect choice for playing Jane Eyre.,0.037606,0.11918,0.063637,0.521278,0.122521,Joy
Looking every bit like 18 thin and frail with irregular strong features she comes closest to my inner vision of Jane than any other actress in that role.,0.072463,0.128752,0.121855,0.105131,0.546342,Sadness
And during the first 15 minutes of her screen time I was enchanted by her performance.,0.048908,0.061924,0.021206,0.449209,0.255039,Joy
Gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask.,0.241092,0.099159,0.335161,0.099105,0.270158,Fear
But unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of Janes character any further.,0.339524,0.171715,0.191962,0.018029,0.438303,Sadness
As a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues Gainsbourghs portrayal of Jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory.,0.16164,0.293834,0.204754,0.021578,0.461788,Sadness
This is a pity as with a better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might have been as good a Jane as Zelah Clarke in the 83 version.,0.108358,0.071384,0.197552,0.337798,0.169768,Joy
But while it is still obvious that Gainsbourgh is trying to play Jane there is no trace whatsoever of Rochester in the character that William Hurt portrays.,0.138284,0.109351,0.161241,0.004906,0.696513,Sadness
His Rochester besides being blond and blueeyed is a softspoken wellmannered nobleman shy and quiet slightly queer and eccentric but basically goodnatured and mild.,0.12625,0.078055,0.264462,0.021057,0.593643,Sadness
He is so far from being irascible moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous.,0.600029,0.401317,0.032672,0.009526,0.157511,Anger
Additionally during many moments of the movie Hurts facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness.,0.213612,0.043887,0.389337,0.004687,0.481,Sadness
Particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open.,0.106775,0.306582,0.118017,0.020328,0.56847,Sadness
Still he offends me less than the Rochesters in the 70 97 and 2006 versions and I would in general rank this Jane Eyre higher than these three other ones.,0.314857,0.2908,0.141366,0.002436,0.444873,Sadness
Hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the Rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so whereas George C. Scott Ciarn Hinds and Toby Stephens thought they could but failed miserably and Id rather watch a character other than Rochester than a Rochester who is badly played.,0.294755,0.176023,0.225492,0.000113,0.485357,Sadness
Of course this Jane Eyre is a failure but at least it is an inoffensive one which is more than one can say of the 97 and 2006 adaptations.,0.126665,0.149878,0.223996,0.007226,0.61403,Sadness
I would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation You will not find Jane Eyre but at least you will find a beautifully made movie.,0.208141,0.151694,0.251444,0.007832,0.522227,Sadness

The film Torrent was a first and a last for Greta Garbo.,0.090971,0.206919,0.168877,0.213847,0.263382,Sadness
It was her first American made film at MGM the only studio in the USA that she would ever work at.,0.15734,0.45247,0.099367,0.158888,0.150983,Disgust
It was also the last time that someone else was billed above her in the credits that being her leading man her Ricardo Cortez.,0.113043,0.561113,0.078544,0.011641,0.38906,Disgust
Torrent is based on the popular Spanish writers Vicente Blasco Ibanezs work Entre Naranjos.,0.106719,0.11197,0.377266,0.159665,0.220271,Fear
It concerns a pair of mismatched lovers Garbo and Cortez who cant quite get together mostly due to the machinations of Cortezs mother Marta Mattox.,0.366307,0.054275,0.247752,0.005962,0.47901,Sadness
Mattox is a wicked woman who has some set ideas about who her son should be marrying.,0.105647,0.276621,0.157868,0.121581,0.3541,Sadness
Remember this is Spain and such arranged marriages were still even in those times quite proper.,0.05108,0.130473,0.096096,0.24466,0.370462,Sadness
Mattox has Gertrude Olmstead in mind as a daughterinlaw shes the offspring of Mack Swain a man grown rich in hog raising.,0.187136,0.322269,0.024112,0.294483,0.115708,Disgust
Swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender concern for the piglets before they grow into big old hogs to be butchered.,0.24772,0.292554,0.277865,0.021182,0.328329,Sadness
Blasco Ibanez had previous novels The Four Horseman Of The Apocalypse and Blood And Sand previously filmed with Rudolph Valentino in the lead.,0.127685,0.318685,0.242414,0.117849,0.240053,Disgust
It might have been interesting if Valentino had done this one with Garbo but he might have been beyond film making when this was done.,0.201945,0.067412,0.125838,0.481347,0.020914,Joy
In any event one of the Valentino wannabes Ricardo Cortez fills in with the male lead.,0.160673,0.397305,0.079278,0.0209,0.485363,Sadness
One reason Valentino might not have wanted this film is because clearly the lead character is Garbos unlike the other two works previously mentioned.,0.193012,0.340706,0.158794,0.020557,0.44513,Sadness
When she gets done dirt by Cortez who is doing what Mattox and her adviser banker Tully Marshall tell her she leaves Spain and goes to France where she becomes a great opera star.,0.153983,0.098494,0.104688,0.232062,0.327849,Sadness
And leads quite the scandalous life there.,0.170169,0.140013,0.184345,0.132119,0.371874,Sadness
When she returns to Spain and tries to rekindle things Mattox is even more outraged.,0.194394,0.194614,0.128245,0.054368,0.511648,Sadness
She has a political career in mind for her son.,0.235448,0.09534,0.036792,0.11647,0.50881,Sadness
Cortez is now running for the Spanish Parliament which curiously enough is called the Cortes.,0.247616,0.071946,0.171819,0.151931,0.345086,Sadness
The title refers to a flood and a dam breaking causing all kinds of havoc in the countryside.,0.4517,0.050439,0.179558,0.001789,0.474335,Sadness
Cortez in fact braves the Torrent in a row boat trying to rescue Garbo from harms way.,0.107803,0.524219,0.216735,0.122396,0.079506,Disgust
When they do get together they have a brutally frank discussion the brutality coming from Garbo.,0.121232,0.161242,0.131255,0.277236,0.22209,Joy
The special effects here primitive though they seem now are quite remarkable for their time.,0.049067,0.018275,0.269119,0.158337,0.427336,Sadness
They look very similar to the shots used in 20th Century Foxs The Rains Came that came out in 1939 and that won an Oscar for Special Effects.,0.045972,0.069695,0.184787,0.208777,0.389121,Sadness
Unfortunately for Torrent it came out one year before Oscar made his debut.,0.053334,0.057718,0.275459,0.137023,0.422931,Sadness
Im not going to give any endings away so youll have to see the film to find out if Cortez and Garbo get together in the end.,0.098915,0.241784,0.205843,0.041083,0.505282,Sadness
Garbo rightly won rave reviews for her performance and in an age when exaggerated gestures was the norm in silent screen acting she was remarkably subtle in her role.,0.111149,0.089167,0.02638,0.461,0.175243,Joy
So she would be the rest of her career she had a remarkable face for closeups.,0.137241,0.393258,0.147252,0.081099,0.323468,Disgust
Although Greta Garbo would go on to do far better work than Torrent this film is still a fitting debut for her on the American big screen and holds up very well for todays audience.,0.095039,0.141725,0.190994,0.122864,0.435876,Sadness
Johnny Dangerously is a sort of hit and miss comedy that has its laughs and huh.,0.099672,0.066374,0.177223,0.02742,0.684345,Sadness
But I suggest to give it a chance.,0.061174,0.087166,0.204454,0.138805,0.453483,Sadness
I think it is greatly over looked.,0.076183,0.165387,0.203559,0.209299,0.283354,Sadness
Not too many people give this movie a chance.,0.044459,0.076532,0.15807,0.174446,0.457715,Sadness
It does work.,0.043813,0.048355,0.455619,0.140973,0.265816,Fear
Just think of it as a little parody of Goodfellas.,0.138515,0.18328,0.200595,0.11113,0.388348,Sadness
Michael Keaton is very funny in his role.,0.055534,0.116696,0.047192,0.533498,0.116247,Joy
And he does it well.,0.044,0.013279,0.098828,0.461945,0.212527,Joy
Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life.,0.096163,0.072499,0.120543,0.167224,0.472766,Sadness

Noone knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject.,0.097198,0.194989,0.121943,0.013223,0.680556,Sadness

They start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days.,0.144237,0.237827,0.145185,0.01654,0.57946,Sadness
All this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen they are outlawed.,0.409017,0.551335,0.13208,0.000428,0.142838,Disgust
Finally they take over a pub in Glenrowan where they have a party with all the visitors waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up.,0.216316,0.243169,0.093093,0.293228,0.109193,Joy

I really couldnt tell you which of them is right perhaps both are but what I can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same.,0.31927,0.093177,0.172006,0.058249,0.442931,Sadness

SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a great follow up after that though it begins to drag.,0.054007,0.025531,0.247255,0.452379,0.076289,Joy
The acting and direction were terrific.,0.143206,0.096694,0.146711,0.107249,0.495567,Sadness

This film was good but I expected more.,0.119751,0.092625,0.080781,0.450169,0.13204,Joy
Look for great cameos by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.,0.046554,0.243142,0.06979,0.509145,0.027122,Joy
or some such time.,0.129483,0.067476,0.049517,0.325489,0.297425,Joy
Its a fitting movie for that time slot since its really hard to follow and quite odd see the other reviews for specific story info.,0.039574,0.045717,0.087225,0.31913,0.354253,Sadness
Anyway after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable TV And even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming I kept catching this little oddity.,0.263949,0.140199,0.063703,0.015601,0.632733,Sadness
After not seeing it for many years I decided to see if I could find it on DVD.,0.097199,0.197222,0.177492,0.142692,0.368068,Sadness
Its usually available for around 10but even much less if you shop around.,0.365967,0.044441,0.297246,0.060853,0.31406,Anger
The other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies so no need to comment on them here.,0.226168,0.128812,0.088878,0.234538,0.261074,Sadness
But I havent seen Eyes available anywhere else.,0.327858,0.051445,0.086032,0.025292,0.605781,Sadness
Though hardly a restored version in any way this print runs exactly 92 minutes so for once IMDbs stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct.,0.074521,0.144359,0.178569,0.101253,0.499537,Sadness
Even with the 92 minute running time its not unusual for a movie dubbed into English from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed.,0.127052,0.291505,0.228673,0.040886,0.424812,Sadness
It seems to be a common budgetconscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story.,0.107152,0.358209,0.052965,0.011069,0.601854,Sadness

Theres something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie.,0.086462,0.018323,0.422161,0.313551,0.042027,Fear
or maybe its just from my earlier experiences who know.,0.104772,0.03013,0.121123,0.285726,0.328876,Sadness
I read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly.,0.2145,0.186023,0.36171,0.017763,0.373216,Sadness
I have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful.,0.321774,0.329473,0.240781,0.027198,0.257475,Disgust
It pains me to write that since I would have hoped this would have been great or I wouldnt have bothered to see it the other day.,0.075998,0.027833,0.194367,0.013645,0.745434,Sadness
I like supporting indie cinema especially if they are gaythemed but this movie is almost too much to tolerate.,0.163874,0.13501,0.104478,0.246201,0.274334,Sadness
Those that walked out as I considered doing after about three minutes probably didnt mind shelling out 11. 00 or just figured it was going nowhere fast and not going to improve.,0.176402,0.186386,0.314215,0.002217,0.48398,Sadness
Maybe I am slightly more optimistic than they are.,0.161351,0.120753,0.317339,0.081237,0.363407,Sadness

That in itself is a major accomplishment.,0.173887,0.037175,0.305781,0.096144,0.389188,Sadness
He didnt grow he didnt change he didnt learn there is no one to teach him anything he DIDNT DO ANYTHING and neither did the movie Scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make.,0.319571,0.19338,0.04609,0.073857,0.441095,Sadness
Additionally the title makes no sense at all.,0.403386,0.096918,0.039844,0.016572,0.569245,Sadness
This film is overblown predictable pretentious and hollow to its core.,0.199676,0.398617,0.126014,0.075458,0.291676,Disgust
The settings are faithful to the era but selfconscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure.,0.375157,0.169677,0.127315,0.083557,0.321825,Anger
The lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue.,0.216034,0.194559,0.298073,0.004398,0.457418,Sadness
Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as Bruce Willis did in Harts War.,0.233031,0.147412,0.171627,0.028187,0.537831,Sadness
Tom you cant give depth to a character simply by making your face blank The content did not warrant the histrionic acting by Paul Newman.,0.060672,0.1364,0.046733,0.325002,0.305051,Joy
This is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing.,0.11712,0.213714,0.252318,0.085945,0.378662,Sadness
As someone who has read the book I can say that this is vastly inferior to the big American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow.,0.04195,0.374855,0.086301,0.025682,0.567629,Sadness
There are various reasons for this.,0.183995,0.096095,0.095016,0.150573,0.440182,Sadness
Firstly Emma is too unpleasant.,0.105261,0.092354,0.097558,0.396795,0.183873,Joy
Yes she has faults and isnt the easiest person to like  but the viewer shouldnt downright start to despise her.,0.285444,0.435974,0.088555,0.060261,0.260649,Disgust
Secondly Mr Knightly is miscast.,0.213679,0.110035,0.155569,0.191623,0.288698,Sadness
His brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen and throw the mood of the whole affair off.,0.213879,0.389986,0.058269,0.05642,0.386928,Disgust
Thirdly Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of Harriet.,0.100965,0.12271,0.099961,0.346444,0.21067,Joy
and why was she made to look so sickly Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming  not to look as if shes going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene.,0.109084,0.416188,0.138529,0.019434,0.453903,Sadness
Fourthly the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut.,0.220045,0.499417,0.064471,0.011167,0.377155,Disgust
At the end when Emma decides she loves Mr Knightly it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative hasnt been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film.,0.030052,0.097885,0.06052,0.41831,0.236494,Joy
Finally this dragged at the end.,0.112172,0.128429,0.245029,0.227282,0.218721,Fear
The book and the big film version end with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly.,0.091596,0.13159,0.226907,0.148457,0.366784,Sadness

All in all a rather haphazard attempt.,0.145762,0.153396,0.189276,0.229349,0.226773,Joy
Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead.,0.144208,0.177403,0.218285,0.029824,0.532355,Sadness

First of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film.,0.191733,0.691003,0.07916,0.057081,0.08333,Disgust
Not movie violence I am talking about REAL violence.,0.621971,0.17637,0.191553,0.010185,0.182273,Anger
This violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two. the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women.,0.217047,0.484368,0.112103,0.001665,0.381409,Disgust
Not that we all dont have some real twists with women.,0.090836,0.463197,0.082492,0.0925,0.324744,Disgust
But the conclusion of the film ruins it all.,0.544135,0.407078,0.130561,0.006966,0.137249,Anger
Of course it is the director who kills the women heroine.,0.276604,0.478285,0.05886,0.016892,0.350191,Disgust

What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you dont see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like Two Towers and Silent Hill.,0.016151,0.078904,0.009756,0.451366,0.270443,Joy

Even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when the ball drops.,0.087063,0.191581,0.136641,0.001732,0.703991,Sadness

Lets just start by saying that other than Qi Yuwus KS and Wong LiLin everybody here of note seems to be a Eurasian.,0.146808,0.296737,0.091932,0.095699,0.413741,Sadness
The love interest is a Eurasian Ananda Everingham and Wongs trio of buddies are all erhem Eurasians.,0.014568,0.019001,0.058888,0.723751,0.069421,Joy
Also everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical anglified accent which doesnt exist anywhere certainly not in Singapore.,0.081994,0.192501,0.18946,0.297355,0.156298,Joy
Its the kind of semiperfect English that authorities would like us speak but which doesnt exist anywhere outside say the MTV Channel.,0.165929,0.180148,0.151659,0.092914,0.449923,Sadness
The effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted not helped by the lack of trueblue Singaporeans in the cast.,0.083608,0.031947,0.275462,0.03768,0.609796,Sadness
The scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string oneliners after oneliners.,0.122559,0.073339,0.221887,0.006392,0.678142,Sadness
After twenty minutes the wit of the movie starts to pall and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clichs.,0.192747,0.429587,0.071261,0.225227,0.070472,Disgust
I guess I didnt enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a love affair over 16 long years seems unbelievable.,0.056953,0.083271,0.032044,0.452214,0.220969,Joy
There are other incredulities in the film.,0.14196,0.368272,0.107384,0.254153,0.09149,Disgust
I cant for one believe that KS played by Qi Yuwu would fall for one of Wongs girlfriends.,0.135401,0.088223,0.103788,0.009194,0.75253,Sadness
And the scene where the bridegroom says Go before I change my mind has been used in a hundred East Asian Korean Chinese Hong Kong Taiwanese etc TV serials.,0.093262,0.265662,0.055561,0.160938,0.39907,Sadness
So 4 stars for this film.,0.069718,0.208768,0.050085,0.475346,0.083196,Joy
The production value is fair and Wong Lilin tries her best but shes not helped by the script.,0.121103,0.058636,0.085143,0.416913,0.189713,Joy
Joan Chen has a 15minute bitpart in the movie as the older Wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot but hey her role is just cameo.,0.03501,0.029411,0.043854,0.571244,0.164145,Joy
Stanley and Iris show the triumph of the human spirit.,0.026918,0.245624,0.095349,0.324056,0.199412,Joy

The beauty of the movie is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda do together starting and stopping before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on.,0.048298,0.021475,0.01984,0.735395,0.070183,Joy
In that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is thus being credible.,0.132128,0.006514,0.037027,0.616837,0.083467,Joy
Unlike some other reviewers I found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture.,0.12531,0.238683,0.162219,0.162081,0.302822,Sadness
The supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances.,0.090453,0.083913,0.078645,0.35845,0.251882,Joy
All in all an excellent movie.,0.032976,0.028426,0.027082,0.763962,0.053313,Joy
The best thing I take from it is Hope.,0.008212,0.018024,0.039475,0.852027,0.019188,Joy

It starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good funny story is to come.,0.031545,0.08736,0.01109,0.650102,0.097157,Joy
Well I can tell you it will not come.,0.203987,0.026083,0.098127,0.015488,0.732362,Sadness
It will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness.,0.089835,0.315976,0.136059,0.016768,0.56516,Sadness
In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that according to him the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience.,0.207673,0.210297,0.058812,0.063112,0.530563,Sadness
I was amazed to hear that.,0.112574,0.150408,0.222684,0.176701,0.300511,Sadness

The integral use of psychiatry coupled with Tonys mother issues are especially fresh and humorous.,0.25519,0.059696,0.009991,0.425432,0.141079,Joy
Several other characters add a lot of depth  Heshs interesting history as an outsider muscling in Ralphies total irredeemable viciousness Chris dual desires in life and so on.,0.092122,0.105942,0.082543,0.468898,0.123044,Joy
I have to dig into some of the criticisms however especially the it glorifies violencebelittles ItalianAmericans one.,0.204545,0.111591,0.123863,0.151411,0.38983,Sadness
Most of the writers and actors are ItalianAmerican would they attack themselves There are several positive ItalianAmerican characters  Artie Bucco the chef Dr. Melfi and her family and the Cusamanos next door to the Sopranos.,0.207103,0.182232,0.181405,0.25323,0.137483,Joy
In both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes.,0.1602,0.312558,0.19999,0.025949,0.44518,Sadness
Most of the characters dont really choose the life they have.,0.161852,0.120962,0.175559,0.107651,0.446715,Sadness
family background or circumstances largely corner them into it.,0.036624,0.032274,0.12775,0.513204,0.136201,Joy
Outsiders even of Italian stock who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends  Matthew and his friend in season 2 for example.,0.10309,0.077585,0.384589,0.025285,0.488343,Sadness
Not everything is perfect however.,0.052395,0.016202,0.02499,0.728589,0.070951,Joy
I dont remember a movie where I have cared less about where the characters have come from what happens to them or where they are going.,0.174018,0.060349,0.249634,0.029784,0.570888,Sadness
I realize that Hollywoods greatest pastime is navelgazing but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with.,0.322708,0.295824,0.028668,0.024569,0.474432,Sadness
indeed its preferable to Hondas lowbrow variations on the monstersontherampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the setup in this case.,0.105472,0.197045,0.153173,0.255954,0.216254,Joy
Apparently a 2disc set of this one from Media Blasters streets on this very day.,0.287551,0.073883,0.102681,0.008378,0.650952,Sadness
This is a movie that gets better each time I see it.,0.060922,0.025113,0.094837,0.465407,0.193144,Joy

I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart as Pirovitch.,0.053743,0.188707,0.038024,0.41072,0.180853,Joy
Very believable in every facet of his role.,0.17632,0.247406,0.214649,0.138749,0.250639,Sadness
The two leads are equally accomplished with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate neurotic yet charming and attractive woman.,0.159543,0.409612,0.125427,0.047912,0.374434,Disgust
This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though.,0.153474,0.066515,0.255503,0.225588,0.226297,Fear
The movie is presented from his point of view with the action rotating around him.,0.105607,0.077893,0.054933,0.603632,0.048616,Joy
Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions.,0.058548,0.052863,0.047847,0.693925,0.044184,Joy
Just watch Stewart when he is fired from his job because of a misunderstanding.,0.348771,0.136543,0.096118,0.122014,0.323749,Anger
He is able to convey the shock anger fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes so perfectly.,0.073914,0.097184,0.841379,0.001233,0.086418,Fear
In my estimation James Stewart is without question the greatest film actor in the history of the medium.,0.112309,0.183743,0.175125,0.358084,0.080611,Joy
There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience.,0.257963,0.070353,0.17848,0.074796,0.468433,Sadness
At the time he made this movie he still had most of his career ahead of him yet he is completely the master of his craft.,0.111797,0.066447,0.028073,0.417507,0.22937,Joy
This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies and also one of the sweetest most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find.,0.022442,0.028865,0.028148,0.789948,0.044669,Joy

However what I didnt quite like was the narration style.,0.206516,0.109184,0.328377,0.040075,0.416544,Sadness
At several points I found the tone overdramatized.,0.208316,0.075849,0.127963,0.120327,0.462047,Sadness

I enjoyed this dalliance with raw wounded gall deep from within.,0.101569,0.52059,0.020608,0.20677,0.117239,Disgust
It empowers a mutually shared vestment in the history of human encounters reaching far deeper into the pain isolation and skewed views of self and others.,0.154905,0.203405,0.093419,0.030082,0.607179,Sadness
The result forgives our tepid forming of a bridge away from the muddy sludge of dead we must encounter.,0.169357,0.459349,0.138285,0.006386,0.40515,Disgust
The birth in finding real people is a happy pursuit.,0.029401,0.028166,0.023528,0.764089,0.05881,Joy
The effort for realism intersects with the dark ground of our bankrupt culture.,0.136078,0.158471,0.50389,0.022653,0.301591,Fear
Me and my friend rented this movie for 2. And we both agree on one thingTHIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADEAlso me and my friend counted 475 face shots.,0.327132,0.261406,0.189082,0.070858,0.267817,Anger
Which makes up 95 of the movie.,0.089026,0.083072,0.090743,0.421757,0.177504,Joy

This movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesnt have any of this in it.,0.119453,0.07035,0.213831,0.091196,0.503478,Sadness
It doesnt give any insight or solutions to the problem.,0.227384,0.071454,0.241614,0.156755,0.287352,Sadness
Its just the portrayal of old male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family.,0.058198,0.471825,0.044234,0.024171,0.509185,Sadness
Why would you want to watch this Its all so totally pointless and meaningless.,0.237615,0.119673,0.089246,0.008612,0.665977,Sadness
It also really doesnt help that the main character is some wrinkly 50 year old male.,0.071954,0.468855,0.081263,0.004812,0.521972,Sadness
Youll have a hard time identifying yourself and sympathize for him.,0.155518,0.069436,0.15927,0.030104,0.653903,Sadness
He just seems like a dirty old playboy who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex.,0.065793,0.817381,0.082282,0.001502,0.153373,Disgust
He has all kinds of sexual intercourses about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutes.,0.064876,0.837207,0.016069,0.024949,0.125711,Disgust
It also doesnt have a bad visual style though it all feels a bit forced.,0.127669,0.050608,0.518488,0.002854,0.420488,Fear
But nevertheless its all better looking than most other directtovideo productions.,0.081155,0.033702,0.089345,0.463652,0.180216,Joy
Who knows if the filmmakers had been given better material to work with the movie would had deserved a better faith.,0.035501,0.037514,0.100236,0.584208,0.101219,Joy
The story really gets ridicules at times.,0.266388,0.214673,0.085648,0.04458,0.494446,Sadness
There are really some pointless plotlines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be.,0.402233,0.22021,0.148091,0.002553,0.421075,Sadness
Im talking about for instance the whole Ordell plotline.,0.198998,0.263826,0.175868,0.074291,0.367807,Sadness
Things get worse once they movie starts heading toward the ending.,0.113915,0.131605,0.326432,0.008456,0.543264,Sadness
Also the whole way the story is being told cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main characters sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple.,0.088856,0.136668,0.113893,0.039816,0.673059,Sadness
But as far as bad movies are concerned this just isnt one of them.,0.253723,0.057553,0.412504,5.2e-05,0.431785,Sadness

Still seems weird and quite amazing that they managed to cast Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. in such a simple small insignificant production as this one is.,0.08055,0.032453,0.253238,0.141525,0.433199,Sadness

For example how do the furlings look like by creating that stupid previously on.,0.515779,0.148967,0.123986,0.03815,0.308855,Anger
is simply embarrassing.,0.106669,0.267397,0.125524,0.06897,0.48878,Sadness

I divide material into three levels.,0.274275,0.157307,0.160885,0.106971,0.342551,Sadness
The first is the stage theatre.,0.120764,0.108344,0.129282,0.357852,0.173075,Joy
Here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and most importantly in the power of the writer.,0.24899,0.219386,0.153453,0.065621,0.400218,Sadness

The best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage cannot show.,0.060162,0.019149,0.024765,0.375727,0.344705,Joy
The second level is film.,0.1762,0.313814,0.134866,0.224006,0.131864,Disgust

Furthermore film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal.,0.134156,0.232535,0.155932,0.257205,0.165226,Joy
The final level is literature.,0.127694,0.103468,0.390648,0.116085,0.267134,Fear
In this context everything is imagined by the author translated onto paper and then reimagined by the reader.,0.122367,0.151365,0.187857,0.307191,0.147224,Joy

Movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies.,0.064883,0.03969,0.078791,0.384118,0.2717,Joy
As for The Last Picture Show it fails.,0.075437,0.212145,0.090754,0.004951,0.729572,Sadness
It is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right.,0.670953,0.184292,0.09037,0.008816,0.215314,Anger

Apart from that I deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film.,0.338265,0.486576,0.127498,0.034708,0.186278,Disgust

I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle.,0.150191,0.156231,0.131273,0.259656,0.230496,Joy
